Its totally free, so what's the catch?
The absolute best meal plans in terms of muscle gain, strength gain, and health are totally free. Free users can make optimal meal plans using keto, low-carb, carb-cycling, medium-carb, bulking, fat-loss, vegan, and vegetarian nutrition types and can make either day meal plans or week meal plans. You can print meal plans, make shopping lists, and order all the dry goods from Amazon in a single click. So why on earth would you pay? We hope you don't! With paid accounts, the feature you get is the ability to edit the meal plans and create your own meal plans. What we have found is that when most people edit meal plans to be more to their taste, they replace vegetables, fruits, and minimally processed foods with less healthy foods leading to inferior meal plans in terms of ability to gain muscle and health. We provide you with both the carrot and the stick for motivation: the absolute best meal plans are completely free but to modify them to suit your tastes, you have to pay.
Why CustomMealPlanner is best for athletes/bodybuilders
CustomMealPlanner was written by athletes, for athletes. Competing bodybuilders, triathletes, runners, and men's physique competitors. We provide the optimal nutrition for you no matter how active you are or what your goal is. We take the guesswork out of both bulking and cutting. The last thing you want to have to do as a powerlifter or bodybuilder is to do a panic starvation diet at the last minute to make your weight class because you will lose all kinds of muscle. With the bodyfat charts provided with every meal plan you can see exactly when you will achieve your target bodyfat and get sixpack abs.
Similarly, we take the guesswork out of bulking also. If you have a good idea what your muscle gain rate will be, we can tell you exactly what kind of caloric surplus you should be running and the weight charts make this clear. Below is an example of a weight chart showing both scale weight and LBM:
