|Printer reset with key then failed waste counter back to 100% after test print. Key no longer works!
2Manuals reply:
There is bug in Epson Photo 1390, 14000, 1410 firmware that put waste counter overflow back again after reset. This problem can be solved by updating printers firmware. Here is step by step manual how to fix it - www.2manuals.-

|Hi John,
I just want to thank you so much for the reset key and software. I paid you $9.99 to get those lights to stop flashing and it the software worked in a matter of minutes! I really appreciate your service, without it I would have to buy a new printer (which I don't want to do right now!).
Thank you again, you provide a great service.

|Wow! Epson wanted standard charge of £118.80 to replace my ink pads. So I bought a set for about a fiver (on eBay). But then Epson would not provide a reset code - they still wanted £118. 80. Then I came across this service and hey presto they provided a code for under a tenner. They deserve all the business
they can get. Well done. From Ken Fuller

|I love printing hard copies of material to review. I bought an Epson EcoTank 2650 for the single purpose of never having to worry about how much I have to print.
When I found out about the ink pad and how it basically “fills up” and prevents you from printing, I was pretty pissed off.
I called a service center in my state in the US and they wanted $110 to replace the ink pad and reset it. I searched hard for a solution and when I found this I was really sure this was a scam.
I tried it from one of your affiliates (octoinkjets) and did the trial to reset it to 90% and it worked.
Thank god you guys have this tool. I bought a key for $10 and was done with it. Watched a video on how to clean the ink pads and it was super easy. Now I have a new printer basically.
I can’t believe Epson gets away with this crap. You guys rock!
It really took a leap of faith to try this.

|I had Epson WF-2650 and it wasn't printing fully, skipping lines, even though colors were full.
I did a lot of cleaning, head cleaning, put new cartridge but no luck. I did some head cleaning using glass cleaner and syringes as shown on various youtube video.
After that, my printer didn't recognize two of the cartridges. I tried everything, cleaning contacts etc, nothing worked.
I was finally going to buy new cartridges however stores were closed today so I decided to look for chip-resetting tool but nothing good was available locally.
I came across this WIC reset utility and was really skeptical if it will work. I took the chance, bought the key, used the tool to reset firmware to chipless firmware, it was successful at the first go.
At this point, printer showed all ink levels 100%. I printed a test page and it came out perfect.
To make it even more interesting for me, I live in Europe and during one of the trip, I bought two sets of XL cartridges for this same model but printer didn't recognize in the past and I was going to throw them since these were no good for my EU model. I tried these again after chip reset firmware and voila, they works too.
I am amazed at the propaganda of these printer manufactures that even original printer cartridges from US didn't work on the model here in EUROPE, these used to fit perfectly but printer wouldn't recognize however, now they works too.
Today, I was almost ready to trash my 2.5 yr old and not much used printer but after a lot of trying and finally using WIC reset utility, the printers works like new and saved me a lot!
These were the best 20 CHF/USD I spent today!
Thank you very much and I don't need to worry about relying on a hardware chip-reset tool. I will now be able to use US model cartridges and re-fill i like without having to worry. I even printed some photos using this same printer on photo paper today and printer did an excellent job.

|Ich bin begeistert! Mit dem TRIAL Key konnte ich meinen Epson XP 750 wieder resetten und er funktioniert wieder. Vielen Dank, dass ich mir dadurch das Geld für einen neuen Drucker sparen konnte und ein Drucker weniger die Umwelt belastet.
War nur etwas anstrengend, die englischen Anweisungen zu lesen und zu übersetzen. Es wäre schön, wenn es diese Seite auch auf Deutsch gäbe.

|My Epson 1400 got the end of life message and I had already reset it once before so I couldn't use the Epson site to reset it. I remembered this site from years ago and purchased the utility reset and it worked like a charm. Only wish I had not spent $400 on a new printer before remembering your site. Anyways I just did a live video showing that this really works on my youtube channel. More people need to know about this remedy!

|Worked hassle free with my Epson XP-55 .
I am very thankful that you provide the SW tool also for Linux as I have gone Microsoft-free at home.
It's cool that you provide a trial license to check out, whether the counter reset works in your setup (I admit I was sceptical). It worked for me and I immediatly ordered the full license.
The good thing is: as it is pure SW, it works also on weekends, when you need to print urgently and that stupid printer decided to not let you print any more!

|Hello there,
I am interested in buying a license key to make my WF-5620 chipless. Firmware upload is completed, I have fear I may have problems with your windows application and firewall. Do you offer support to make the License app work ?
Thank you, resetters !

|I was skeptical in using this tool, but to my surprise and delight it worked like a charm using the serial key (trial) for a quick 10%reset of my Epson Artisan 830. Yes, meaning that if you don't buy the key, it will only reset your printer 10% of the way. My counters are now at 89.99% and 90.00%. It states these counters will reach maximum soon. I only wanted to use the fax option of this printer since I bought a new printer with fill tanks that hasn't arrived yet. This product worked perfectly. I wish I knew about it this software tool before buying a new printer......
