BreezingForms is THE form builder for Joomla!® and WordPress® that goes the extra mile! From simple forms to complex form applications, almost everything is possible.
BreezingForms has a long history of innovations and its mission is always to be ahead of the competition. BreezingForms constantly introduces new features, best practices and even enterprise features that you usually don't see in the CMS world.
Best examples are Twitter Bootstrap support, responsive layouts, mobile-only support, Google Drive® Spreadsheets, DropBox® and content construction integration using our popular Joomla!® extension ContentBuilder.
Available for Joomla!® 3.x / 2.5 and WordPress® 4x
BreezingCommerce is a new Joomla! shopping cart for small to mid-size online stores, focused on ease-of-use and providing as many useful out-of-the-box features as possible.
It provides a clever plugin system to add even more features such as our amazing BreezingForms integration, which supports freestyle product configuration and price updates!
Additionally, BreezingCommerce ships with a straight-forward shopping experience.
E.g. preventing customers from being distracted by irritating cross-linking in the checkout process, keeping drop-off levels as low as possible.
Available for Joomla!® 3.x
While being an easy-to-use, quick and powerful content construction kit that everybody understands, ContentBuilder fills the gap between cracks and regular Joomla!® users, who finally want to get the advantages of a CCK.
It can also replace a number of extensions that you use just by its ability to present content in ways that YOU like it be, not the other way.
ContentBuilder is THE swiss army knife to your Joomla! site. No matter if you need to create a CRUD application (create, read, update, delete) with list detail views or generate articles out of your collected data, go for ContentBuilder. It's recommended to try ContentBuilder yourself to get an idea what is possible.
Available for Joomla!® 3.x / 2.5
