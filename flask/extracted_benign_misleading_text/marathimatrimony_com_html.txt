About MarathiMatrimony
MarathiMatrimony, pioneered by BharatMatrimony, is the matrimony space where you Marathi brides
and grooms
find each other.
Marathi weddings are usually held during the day and are rich with rituals.
Sakhar Puda, meaning sugar packet, is an important pre-wedding function in Marathi tradition. The families exchange sweets and sugar packs once the marriage is fixed.
During the wedding or lagna, the bride is escorted to the stage by her maternal uncle. The bride and groom wear mundavalya (flower strings) on their heads. Garlands and vows are exchanged, the couples are showered with unbroken rice grains. After this ceremony the father of the bride gives her away, and the groom puts the mangalsutra around the bride's neck. The ceremony comes to a close when the couple takes seven steps near the sacred fire.
