Find a Society
Ongoing professional education, volunteer opportunities, and great networking events are just a few of the benefits offered by CFA Societies.
Whether youâ€™re a current CFA Institute member, a CFA Program candidate, a partnering institution, or just seeking additional information, use the global society directory below to connect with a local member society on your travels, to find society events, and to expand your professional network.
Traveling? The Global Passport Program allows members of participating CFA societies to attend each other's society events at the local member price.
