Our Research
Our highest priority project is funding clinical trials of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a tool to assist psychotherapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
We have also sponsored completed clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety associated with life-threatening illness, and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for social anxiety in autistic adults.
MAPS has completed the first double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the therapeutic use of LSD in human beings since the early 1970s.
Ibogaine Therapy for Drug Addiction
We have completed studies of the long-term effects of ibogaine treatment on patients undergoing therapy at independent ibogaine treatment centers in Mexico and New Zealand.
MAPS supports research into the safety and effectiveness of ayahuasca-assisted treatment for drug addiction and PTSD. We also support conferences, meetings, and publications about the scientific, therapeutic, sustainable, and spiritual uses of ayahuasca.
MAPS has completed the first-ever clinical trial of smoked marijuana for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans of war.
