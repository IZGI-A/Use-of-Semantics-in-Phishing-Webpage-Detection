This Saturday night, October 26th, come down to Monty Hall for a night of singinâ€™ hosted by a man who is no slouch in the vocal department himself, Mr. Clay Pigeon! Pick a song, take to the stage, and let out your inner Lady Gaga or Bruce Springsteen. Only $5 at the door, and adult beverages are on-site to give you Dutch courage.
