The Challenge duration is 30 calendar days, the Verification duration is 60 calendar days.
If you manage to pass the Trading Objectives sooner, you do not need to wait for the remaining duration days.
For example, if you pass all the Trading Objectives of the Challenge in just 11 days, no need to wait another 19 days. We will advance you to the Verification as soon as possible.
Minimum trading days
10 days
10 days
10 days
To meet this objective, you must trade for at least 10 days during the testing period. At least one position must be opened in each of these days.
A trading day is defined as a day when at least one trade is executed.
If a trade is held over multiple days, only the day when the trade was executed is considered to be the trading day.
Positive days
50 %
50 %
❌
You must reach at least 50% of positive days compared to the number of negative days, where a positive day is considered to be such a day where the value of the account balance is higher at 23:59:59 CE(S)T than it was on the same day at 0:00:01 CE(S)T.
Maximum Daily Loss
$500
$500
$500
This rule can also be called “trader’s daily stop-loss”. According to our rules, this is set as 5% (10% in case of an Aggressive version) from the initial capital value. The rule says that in any moment of the day (CE(S)T – Central European Summer Time), the result of all closed positions in sum with the currently open floating P/Ls (profits/losses) must not hit the determined daily loss limit. The counting formula:
Current daily loss = results of closed positions of this day + result of open positions.
For example, in a case of the Challenge with the initial capital of €40000, the Max Daily Loss limit is €2000. If you happen to lose €1000 in your closed trades, your account must not decline more than €1000 this day. It must also not go -€1000 in your open floating losses. The limit is inclusive of commissions and swaps.
Vice versa, if you profit €2000 in one day, then you can afford to lose €4000, but not more than that. Once again, be reminded that your Maximum Daily Loss counts your open trades as well. For example, if in one day, you have closed trades with a loss of €1000 and then you open a new trade that goes into a floating loss of some -€1200 but ends up positive in the end, unfortunately, it is already too late. In one moment, your daily loss was -€2200 on the equity, which is more than the permitted loss of €2000.
Be careful, the Maximum Daily Loss resets at midnight CE(S)T! Let’s say that one day you had a profit of €600. On the same day, you have an open position with a currently floating loss of €2500. On this day, the maximum daily loss is not violated. The current daily loss is €1900. ( €600 closed profit – €2500 open position). However, if you hold this position with the open loss of €2500 after midnight, the daily loss limit will be violated. This is because your previous day profit doesn’t count to a new day and the open loss of €2500 exceeds the max daily permitted loss of €2000.
The size of the Maximum Daily Loss gives trader enough space for trading and it guarantees a clearly defined daily risk to the investor. Both the trader and investor benefit from this rule as the account value will not drop below the limit. That’s also why Maximum Daily Loss limit includes your possible floating losses.
You can get more insight into why this rule is in place in this article.
Maximum Loss
$1,000

$1,000
This rule can also be called “account stop-loss”. The equity of the trading account must not, at any moment during 30-days duration, decline below 90% of the initial capital. For the Challenge with the capital of $100,000, it means that the account lowest possible equity can be $90,000. Again, this is a sum of both closed and open positions (account equity, not balance). The logic of the calculation is same as with the Maximum Daily Loss, the only difference is that it’s not limited to one day but the entire duration of the testing period. The limit is inclusive of commissions and swaps.
10% of the initial capital gives trader enough space to prove that his/her account is suitable for the investment. It is a capital buffer that should keep the trader in the game even if there were some initial losses. The investor has an assurance that the trader’s account cannot decline below 90% (80% in case of Aggressive version) of its value under any circumstance.
Profit Target
$1,000
$1,000 $500
❌
The Profit target in the Challenge is set to 10% (20% in the Aggressive level) of the initial balance and 5% (10% in the Aggressive level) in the Verification. Profit target means that a trader reaches a profit in the sum of closed positions on the assigned trading account anytime within 30 calendar days in the Challenge or anytime within 60 calendar days in the Verification. Also, at the end of the trading period, all positions must be closed.
For example: If you trade Challenge with $100,000 capital, your profit target is $10,000 in the Challenge and then $5,000 in the Verification.
Note that we will provide you with a new free Challenge every time you meet all the Trading Objectives except for the Profit Target. In order to receive the new Challenge for free, your account balance must be positive at the end of the time period.

In order to supress bad habits and unwanted behaviour, it is essential to find a source of such a behaviour and this isn’t always easy. For this reason, we have hired a qualified performance psychologist to our team. She is helping the top athletes with the same pitfalls that we face too as traders. Our psychologist will lay down some particular questions specific to every individual and will try to guide you to understand the problems. The mutual cooperation should result in a long-term solution and eliminate the unwanted manners and consequently lead to a better trading results.
As soon as we decided to create this project, we knew that we have to offer to our traders an unbiased look at their trading results. Why?
