As a former medical student, I pursued my passion for software engineering by enrolling into Holberton School, a full stack software engineering school in San Francisco. I tackled low-level programming, DevOps & database management, higher level programming and building web applications to round out my foundations curriculum.
I am looking for an opportunity to use my education and industry experience to work with an agile growing team. I want to align myself with a company I believe in and where I can create positive change. I thrive under pressure and welcome challenges, especially in a positive team environment.
