-
Having a last will in place will make sure your estate goes to whom you want, when you want,
the way you want. When you have a well thought out and executed will, you feel safe and secure that no
matter what happens you have a plan to deal with it and you have your team in place to carry it out.
This allows you to put those concerns out of your mind and enjoy your life.
-
A living trust can save your heirs legal fees, taxes and time in settling your affairs. By planning ahead
with a trust, you can shorten the settlement process, and avoid assets getting tied up in lengthy estate
proceedings.
-
A health care power of attorney allows you to document your wishes regarding medical care and guarantees
these wishes will be carried out if you become disabled. About half of all people today have a period of
disability before they die. A health care power of attorney can also allow you to name someone to make
decisions about your medical treatment if you are unable to make them yourself.
-
A financial power of attorney provides authority for someone to act on your behalf in case you become
incapacitated. A financial power of attorney takes effect if the principal becomes incompetent or is
otherwise incapable of handling his or her affairs. Many individuals name someone as their agent for
financial matters in the event that they become unable to make their own decisions or if they are unable
to due to military status, travel abroad, or extended illness.
