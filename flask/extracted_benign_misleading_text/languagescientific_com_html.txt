Types of Life Science Documents We Translate
Language Scientific has been a longstanding partner for Healthcare companies, providing comprehensive and customized localization solutions. Language Scientific’s translators understand that patient-facing materials must be written at the patients’ reading level. Owing to a strict internal quality control protocol, Language Scientific is able to provide a Certificate of Translation Accuracy with each project. Our unique methodology that clients depend on delivers consistently clear, accurate translation of high-value information.
Our Healthcare translation services include:
In addition to medical translation services, Language Scientific offers a variety of language services to hospitals, including:
Verbal On-Demand Phone Interpreting – Available 24/7 365 days a year in over 150 languages
Patient Instructed SIG Translations – Massive online, growing database of
foreign language drug instructions to print directly onto prescription labels
Language Scientific can help you with a wide range of requirement types including staying within the framework of ITAR guidelines in many different functional areas.
The following are examples of our expertise but not limited to:
The typical documents we translate for our Energy Industry clients include:
Companies that provide architectural and engineering solutions must communicate with engineers and business decision makers. Eventually the content must also be accessible to the end users of their products and services. Throughout the process of procurement, design, engineering, execution and maintenance, the Engineering Services provider must ensure adequate communication as part of their solutions package.
Often this communication needs to be translated into various languages. In order to translate it correctly, one MUST understand the source correctly.
“If You Don’t Understand It, You Cannot Translate It!”
To illustrate, can you explain the following terms in the context of power generators?
Offline Fill Fail Ttimer
Generator Room Diff Press
Black Start Status Integer
We work with all aspects of industrial manufacturing documentation including:
The chemicals industry must follow regulations and conform to the requirements of leading industry associations. Chemical manufacturers constantly produce and update:
Depending on location, these documents must be translated into one or several languages and filed. In the case of MSDS documents, Language Scientific is aware that layout is important. For example, the MSDS could be created with 8 section headers (OSHA standard) or with 16 section headers (ANSI standard).Learn More
Electronic Engineering covers a wide range of products used in manufacturing and consumer electronic goods. From circuits and mother boards to transformers and semiconductors, these products are developed by engineers for engineers. Often the research, product development, marketing and sales for such products is dispersed amongst different locations. This enhances the need to communicate effectively with experts, engineers, manufacturers and eventually the sales team and prospective clients. Needless to say, precision in understanding the concepts and products is crucial to effective communication.
For instance in the sentence: “The compressor enclosure and skid has provision for bolt down via bolt down lugs,…” it is vital to understand the context, and be familiar with the machine, in order to communicate this correctly in any language. A diagram may not be enough to communicate this information—it requires hands-on experience working as a mechanical engineer.Learn More
Technology defined by innovative leaps or human capital are expanding globally at rapid pace. Competition to grow existing mature domestic operations as well as expand into new international countries requires bold ideas that will influence buyers and markets around the globe. Companies are marketing to key emerging markets such as Latin America, India and China and also establishing global production facilities to reduced labor costs. Global success depends on providing language specific materials and instructions.
Language Scientific has been a long-standing collaborator in the Information Technology sector, working with clients such as Microsoft, EMC and Alcatel-Lucent to help these companies communicate precisely yet cost-effectively in more than 150 languages. Language Scientific’s subject matter experts have laboratory experience, coupled with extensive hands-on usage of source and translated documents. They assure precision and usability of the translation. Language Scientific’s in-house Desktop Publishing Team customizes the layout of the translated documents to provide a translated product that is guaranteed to meet regulatory requirements.Learn More
Patent Translation by Subject Matter Experts
Language Scientific employs only patent translators and translation editors who hold technical degrees such as MSEE, PhD, or MD in engineering, science, medicine or computer science. All patent translators translate only into their native language, and have extensive background not just in technical translation but specifically in the field of patent translation.
For example, all patent translators and editors working on translating a biochemistry patent application or specification from Japanese to English are biochemists who are native speakers of English. They hold an MS or a PhD degree in biochemistry and have a minimum of 7 years experience in patent translation.Learn More

How Is Localization Different from Translation?
Localization of software is adapting software for use in various languages and locales. Localization involves more than just translation of User Interface (UI) and documentation. Software may need to be adapted for dealing with:
Localization Engineering
Language Scientific uses the latest technology to provide localization engineering solutions. We have the capability in-house to work with just about any technology in use on the web. Our localization engineering team is experienced in a variety of web based applications and formats including (.asp, .html, .dhtm, .php). All file types are carefully analyzed, prepared for translation, and engineered with the best possible consideration for time and quality.
A few of the commonly used applications and tools used for website localization are listed below.
We can advise you on best practices and the benefits of techniques to streamline the localization process, maintain consistent output and reduce costs for reaching a global marketplace.Learn More

We are here to answer any questions you may have throughout your multimedia localization project.Learn More
Simultaneous Interpreting
Most frequently used for large conferences or meetings, simultaneous interpreting requires the linguist to “translate” what the speaker is saying as they speak.
Consecutive Interpreting
During consecutive interpreting, the speaker speaks for a few minutes (a few paragraphs), then pauses. The interpreter takes notes and then orally conveys (translates) the speaker’s message during the pause.
Escort Interpreting
Another form of consecutive interpreting is often called escort interpreting. If you are hosting a delegation of visitors from another country, you may want to use an escort interpreter for meeting clients at the airport, tours and excursions. Escort interpreters generally translate informal conversations.
Over-the-Phone Interpreting
Telephone interpreting (also called OPI or Over-the-Phone Interpretation) can be either simultaneous or consecutive. If the participants of a telephone call are content to hear only the voice of the interpreter, telephone interpreting can be conducted in a simultaneous mode.
All our On-Demand Phone Interpreters have professional work experience and the following skills:
