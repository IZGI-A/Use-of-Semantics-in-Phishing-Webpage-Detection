Furk.net is your personal secure storage that fetches media files and lets you stream them immediately
You can use it to stream video or listen to your music from PC, smartphone, HTPC or even a game console (XBOX, PS3).Service limits:
- Bandwidth limit: up to 250GB per month
- Disk storage limit: unlimited (as long as files are from public sources)
Furk.net is not a file locker and doesn't support filesharing for profit.
