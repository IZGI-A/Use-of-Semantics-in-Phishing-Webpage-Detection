- [High-grade lens] TAC polarized lens has the characteristics of impact resistance, scratch resistance, light weight and durability. The lens is coated with a 100% UV400 protective film to block 100% of harmful UVA and UVB rays, which can effectively eliminate glare and reduce eye fatigue.
- [Ultra Light] 30g lightweight glasses with non-slip nose pads and rubber ear pads and adjustable temples, which can reduce the pressure on the nose and ears caused by wearing glasses for a long time.
- [Curved and wider design] The large lens not only provides a wider field of view, but also more wind and dustproof, and can better protect the eyes from insects. The curved lens design has low air resistance and is suitable for high-speed riding.
- [The frame Design]The ergonomic soft nose pad is very suitable for all face shapes. The frame can also adjust the height of the glasses and the distance from the face to prevent the glasses from slipping off. Suitable for various outdoor scenes.
- [TR90-Comfort] The entire frame is made of lightweight and durable TR90, so you will not feel discomfort even if you wear it for a long time. The packaging of cycling sunglasses is made of lighter materials and can be hung on the waist, making it more convenient to use.
