MediaArea
MediaArea is an open source software company focused on digital media analysis. We develop and support tools that aid developers in integrating digital media file investigation into their work.
We do mostly open source code, without rejecting proprietary code on request.
MediaInfo is our flagship product with 4 000 downloads per day, we also currently work on MediaConch, and we worked in the past on QCTools, BWF MetaEdit and some other projects.

Other projects
We are not directly involved in these projects but we use them for A/V analysis, and we sometimes send patches to these projects.
Standardization of open source formats focused on lossless storage.
Matroska / FFV1 / FLAC.
Capture a video signal and turn it into a digital file.
Web app to accompany QCTools.
A lot used by ourselves for A/V analysis, used by QCTools.
Help users through the command generation process so that more people can reap the benefits of FFmpeg.
Events
We also organize or participate to several A/V related events.
