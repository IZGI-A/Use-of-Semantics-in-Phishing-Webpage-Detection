TELL US WHAT YOU WANT
Submit your sticker request to us. We have custom sticker experts standing by 7am-5pm MST. Some stickers and labels can be priced by our system, and some will need to be quoted by our team. We'll even send you samples to test.
UPLOAD YOUR ARTWORK
Get started to upload your artwork file. We accept any type of file format and offer many sticker templates for designers and artists to get started. If your artwork isn't set up for print, no worries, we can probably set it up for free. More about artwork.
APPROVE YOUR PROOF
We want you to love your stickers so we will send you an email when your proof is ready to be approved. At this time you can approve or request changes, and our art department will make it happen. Production starts as soon as you approve your proof!
WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING
I have used Sticker Giant several times to order all kinds of different stickers for my company's events. Every time, it has been a great experience and the finished product has been great as well! The website is super awesome and easy to use. I really like that I can get a price instantly on the website, but I have also gotten custom quotes by calling, which is super easy as well. I would definitely recommend Sticker Giant for anyone's sticker needs!
