I had been searching Kijiji and Realtor.ca for over a month looking for the right place, and I mentioned to an associate that I was looking for an office. He recommended Spacelist, and after 5 minutes I found the perfect place. The quality of the listings is much better than Kijiji or Realtor, the search functionality is great, and it is a more focused experience.

I setup a query in Spacelist and was notified every time something in our range came up. That is a fantastic feature! That automatic email function saved us a lot of time and when we got the listing for this place we jumped on it.

I found Spacelist through Google while searching for a new rental property and after that it became the go-to website for all my research. I used it extensively for about 6 months while searching.

Co-founder & CEO, StandardFusion
Being able to filter available locations on a map based on our very specific requirements was key. Having them delivered directly to my inbox as they became available meant we were on top of a very busy Vancouver market and able to pounce as soon as what we needed came up.

I googled "commercial space listings bc" and found Spacelist...it was very helpful to have a direct messaging function on the website to speak with the listing agent. Spacelist's map view function is incredibly nice. The left-hand side’s sorting and the interactive element on the map is all very engaging. Spacelist is definitely my top pick for commercial locations going forward.
