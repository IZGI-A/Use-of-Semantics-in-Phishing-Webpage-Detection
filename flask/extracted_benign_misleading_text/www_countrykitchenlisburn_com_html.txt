About Us
The Country Kitchen was established in 1980 by Bill & Roberta Ferguson. Starting off as a new business venture, The Country Kitchen was originally located in smaller premises at 49 Sloan Street.
1984 saw Bill’s son Chris join the family business as an apprentice baker. In 1990 after many successful years and a steady growth in business, The Country Kitchen expanded it’s premises by acquiring 2 residential houses and building the Restaurant and Bakery as it is today.
With a vibrant shop & restaurant, we have been providing fresh produce and a relaxed, friendly environment to all of our customers for almost 40 years.
