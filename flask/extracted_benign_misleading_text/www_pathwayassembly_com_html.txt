our core values
A church where everyone is known, supported and no one is left out.
A church that lives together genuinely, intimately and without judgment.
Pathway Tots
ages 0-3
We are here to provide a clean, safe, and nurturing environment where your baby or toddler can experience God's love! We want parents to feel respected, loved and know that their child is well cared for.
Pathway kids
We are committed to creating safe and fun environment where your children are taught
about the Bible and the love of Jesus through relevant, age-appropriate kid's church on
Sunday mornings. Our ultimate hope is to see
a generation of children come to know
God at an early age.
