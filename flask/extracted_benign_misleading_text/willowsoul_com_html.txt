7 Reasons Why You're Seeing 111
The Universe works in mysterious ways to catch your attention in order to direct you on your destined path. To guide you safely at this stage of your spiritual development, the Universe sends angels to communicate messages that can show up as repetitive numbers.
When you see the number pattern 111 repetitively, there are multiple meanings, and it's important to carefully sense what 111 means to you. To help you decode the angel messages, here are 7 spiritual meanings and reasons of why you are seeing 111 or 1:11 everywhere around you.
11:11 Art Print: "Maybe They'll Notice The Sign This Time"
The Universe is always trying to get your attention by sending signs to connect with you, guide you, and wake you up.
In this Willow Soul exclusive artwork, two angels are trying to signal "your" attention with a large 11:11 billboard sign as a way to slow you down and give you the present time to steer your life in the direction that is most meaningful for you.
11:11 Art Print: "Wake Up, It's 11:11"
“Wake Up, It's 11:11” is a vintage-inspired pencil-style drawing that was created to remind you about your purpose in the world.
In this Willow Soul exclusive artwork, an alarm clock rings at 11:11 to wake "you" up from a sleeping life, and it serves as a trigger to remind you of who you are, what you want, and why you are here.
444 Art Print: "You Asked For A Sign"
When you ask for help, you're always being guided with signs from the Universe to help you make the best choices in life that are right for you.
In this Willow Soul exclusive artwork, an angel gives "you" a sign that you have asked or prayed for. At the same time, you feel the urge to look at the clock on the bedroom wall, and then you see the time 4:44. This is your angel's way to let you know that you're safe, protected, and completely supported.
555 Art Print: “Change Is Coming, Your Lucky Numbers Are 5-5-5”
Life is all about change, and it’s always in motion and moving you forward to get you to where you need to be. In this Willow Soul exclusive artwork, a fortune-teller pulls out the Sun card from the tarot card deck for "you." The Sun card represents the confidence you're building in yourself because you’re connecting with your true self by being aware of what's meaningful to you. When you are living as your true self, the Universe rearranges itself and guides you toward something unexpected and greater on your journey. Your path is illuminated with the sun’s radiant rays as you reach your goals and prepare for positive change.
And simultaneously, the numbers 5-5-5 appear as a vision on the crystal ball and the time on the owl clock is 5:55. The 3-digit number 555 confirms that big changes are in sight for you, and it’s a reminder that you are always presented with opportunities for new beginnings.
