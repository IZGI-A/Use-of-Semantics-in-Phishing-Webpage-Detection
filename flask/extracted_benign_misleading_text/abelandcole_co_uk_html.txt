Our new office delivery service
Our new office delivery service
Exciting news for all London working folk. We've launched a new office delivery service, Fed by Abel & Cole. Our team there deliver 100% organic food and drink to workplaces in central London, by zero-emission electric bikes. The range is based on ours but designed for office life, so it slots right into busy working days or team catch-ups. We’re talking seasonal fruit, milk from grass-fed cows, single-origin coffee, craft beers, light lunches and much more – even fresh, handmade, flaky, buttery pastries.
Farmers, makers and bakers
Farmers, makers and bakers
We’ve worked with master craftsmen and women for donkeys’, speaking with them every day and often stopping by to have a glimpse of their new harvests. They share our commitment to ethically made food, and being organic means they have the highest animal welfare standards. We think they’re superheroes. Every wellie wearing, hand harvesting, flat cap donning, weather worshipping one of them.
"Amazingly good!"
Abel and Cole have added a completely new dimension to my life! The produce is amazingly wholesome and good. The service is excellent.
