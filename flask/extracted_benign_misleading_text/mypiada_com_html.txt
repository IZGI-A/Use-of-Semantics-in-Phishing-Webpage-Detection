Welcome to
We are passionate about food and about sharing it with others. We believe in eating well even when we need to eat fast. Great food starts with a few simple, fresh ingredients and someone who knows how to bring the best flavors to life. Every Piada is run by a chef — not a manager — who will personally greet you as you step up to the stone.
Our open kitchen design invites you to share in the experience as our chef crafts your meal, to order — Piadas, Pasta Bowls, and Chopped Salads all to be enjoyed in our dining room or on the run. It's good food, made fast, made fresh. Every time.
It all
started witha sketchon a napkin
It was on a trip to Rimini, Italy, where our chefs found inspiration in the distinct charm of the roadside food trucks and corner markets that served centuries-old family recipes. As the aromas of fresh basil and cured meats wafted through the air, we shared some of the most satisfying hand-made meals that were made with some of the simplest, freshest ingredients. At that moment we knew we had to capture the essence of Rimini and bring it back to the United States.
When we opened our first Piada restaurant in 2010, we held true to what we learned — that every meal should be a great meal shared with family and friends — old and new. As you walk through our doors, we invite you to join in a meal with our family. One that’s been hand-crafted just for you by our chef. And to savor the Piada experience, knowing you can always eat well and enjoy good food fast.
