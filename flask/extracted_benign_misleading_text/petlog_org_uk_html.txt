Welcome to Petlog. Microchipping is one of the most effective ways to reunite lost pets with their keepers. However, it is only effective if keepers remember to ensure that their contact details are kept up to date.
Your pet's microchip contains a unique number, which is matched on our database. You and your pet's details are now recorded with us.
You now need to create an account with Petlog to view and verify the details we hold about you and your pet.
It is vital to keep your contact details up-to-date. To update your details and to access more features, upgrade to Petlog Premium for Â£17 for the lifetime of your pet.
