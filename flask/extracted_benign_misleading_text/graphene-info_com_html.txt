2D fab, together with SAAB and Blackwing Sweden, developed new graphene-enhanced components for the aviation industry that offer increased lightning strike protection and strength.
The project, called Multigraph, was launched in 2017 with the mission to create better components for the aviation industry. The aim was to use grapheneâ€™s multifunctional properties to increase the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the materials used, the latter reducing the amount of maintenance required due to lightning strikes.
