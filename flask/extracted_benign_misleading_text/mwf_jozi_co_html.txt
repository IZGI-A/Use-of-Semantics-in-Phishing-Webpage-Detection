Getting started with MWF
MWF works together as a series of page types, modules, and components. Itâ€™s a system that allows site authors to consider how best to tell the story of Microsoft products and services with confidence that the modular pieces will support and work together. If you are new to MWF take a look at the general workflows for designers and developers, or get started by downloading our files or connecting to our CDN.
