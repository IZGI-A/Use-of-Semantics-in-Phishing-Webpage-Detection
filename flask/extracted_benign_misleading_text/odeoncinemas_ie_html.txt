Amazing ISENSE
See the film, bigger and brighter than ever before.
Super sized screens measuring floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall, with state-of-the-art 4K digital projectors make for an eye-popping experience that brings you closer to the action. Combined with Dolby® Atmos™, a sound system that introduces a powerful new listening experience to cinema goers, ISENSE is an incredible experience that will blow you away.
Spectacular 3D
3D is an ultra-realistic experience. Digital RealD 3D technology brings you spectacular 3D imagery that pops out of the screen right in front of your eyes and your senses are heightened as the film comes alive.
Put on your RealD 3D glasses, sit back and be stunned - this is 3D.
