Kudos to Playlist Push for taking the initiative in developing a transparent and streamlined process for connecting independent artists to playlist curators.
The service is great and gives an opportunity to independent artist to have a fighting chance when most of the Spotify playlist are influenced by major labels. My personal experience landed me on some great playlist which brought me to almost 50,000 streams on my current single.
