Very strong customer orientation
Nebu Customer Care offers a help desk with a very strong customer orientation. Tickets are processed and resolved quickly. The crucial point is; for urgent requests all available resources are bundled to guarantee a rapid solution, especially in critical project phases Customers feel secure. I worked also for a Service Company for some years, and people who spent Time in such Customer Operations know that it is definitely no easy Task. Especially In a larger company with many inquiries and requests, tickets may get victims of longer waiting time â€¦unintentionally. I can put a Service Desk in 3 Words: Stress-bound, time-critical and Challenging. The Nebu team meets these requirements with flying colors. Nebu offers a prime example of customer care.
