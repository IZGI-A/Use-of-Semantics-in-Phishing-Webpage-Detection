GET TO KNOW US BETTER
WE ALWAYS PREPARE FOOD JUST BEFORE SERVING IT TO YOU
The secret of the perfect taste of food lies in the process of its preparation. Every stage is important here. That's why we, at KFC, do everything from scratch. Every day, we prepare meat with our own hands: we dredge it, fry it and then grill it. Only meals served immediately after preparation keep their perfect taste.
MEAT IN KFC:
only whole chicken pieces
not minced
prepared by hand, just before serving
GOOD BECAUSE FRESH
FRESH PRICE OVER EVERYTHING
For the meal to be tasty and well-made, all ingredients must be fresh and of the highest quality. This is obvious to us. That's why products we order for our restaurants are delivered several times a week, only from proven, local farms.
DELIVERIES IN KFC:
only from local, nearby farms
2-3 times a week
up to 101 restaurants
WE FOCUS ON PROXIMITY
LOCAL IS THE BEST
We work only with trusty local suppliers. Therefore, you can be sure that the meat that we serve in our restaurants comes only from breeders, whom we have known for years and which we trust in. We want to serve only the best natural products, which is why we always choose the most valued suppliers for whom freshness and quality are priority values.
QUALITY AT KFC:
