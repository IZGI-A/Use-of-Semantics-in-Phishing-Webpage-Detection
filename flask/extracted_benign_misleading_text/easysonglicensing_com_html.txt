These folks are great to work with. Very responsive. And when needed, you can get a real person on the phone! Keep up the good work!

Easy Song Licensing is a jewel in a pile of rocks. Customer service? When you call you get a real person. Imagine that! This was my first CD and they answered all of my dumb questions with patience and humor. What a relief. Thanks Easy Song Licensing for being there.

I've used several other services for licensing before, and these guys are by far the easiest, quickest, and so helpful! They answered my questions about which type of license, and were really helpful in finding authors on some obscure stuff that I couldn't find thru the PROs!

Great site to get a mechanical license and find those hard to reach music producers to get clearance on popular cover songs.

We had a great experience working with ESL. They answered all of our questions and were very prompt at responding to our calls or emails. Looking forward to working with them on other licensing projects. They're the best!
