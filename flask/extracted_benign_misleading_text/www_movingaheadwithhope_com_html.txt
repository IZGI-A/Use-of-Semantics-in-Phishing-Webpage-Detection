Combining Hope With Action
Moving Ahead with Hope supports the aspirations and goals of adults living with cognitive, mental health or neurological challenges to lead more satisfying, productive and independent lives.
Moving Ahead with Hope provides coaching, strategies and opportunities
to empower individuals to grow in different areas of their lives; to increase their ability to self-advocate; and to explore the challenges and rewards of successfully living and working in the community.
Without hope we can’t dream
With hope, we can take a step forward, no matter how big or small, even if it is scary or out of our comfort zone. Everyone has a contribution to make in the world.
Coaching involves person-centered planning that is effective, productive and collaborative to meet the needs of an individual and to provide support to families.
It is a special privilege
to support people to figure out their next best step in life.
I love working with adults who, whatever their age, want to experience that “first” real job, or move outside the family home; the experience of feeling empowered to make their own decisions… and adults who strive to find or maintain purpose and meaning in their lives while experiencing transitions due to changing circumstances or growing older.

"In life, one remembers those times where a shift was made. Where a person or a decision subtly or sometimes drastically altered the future for the better. I call these times turning points. Mine can be counted on one hand.
Robin empowered me to make my own choices in regards to my vocational future when I desperately needed that loving and at the same time firm nudge of support. Here I am today, grateful that I can give back to a person who gives so much to the people who need that extra special guidance in their journey. Thank you so much Robin."
