Grand Canyon Railway & Hotel
All aboard to the Grand Canyon! Travel in a restored passenger car behind a vintage locomotive while being entertained by cowboy characters and western musicians. Ride the rails to the rim of the canyon. Plus, with hotel options at both ends of the line itâ€™s easy to plan a package with everything you need.
