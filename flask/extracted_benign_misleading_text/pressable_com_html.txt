Pressable is leading the industry with WordPress support. This team is so easy to work with, and they truly care about our success. Highly Recommended!
Lani Rosales, COO at The American Genius
At a time when any other hosting company would have said “fix it yourself”, Pressable’s team just dove in and fixed all of our sites. We broke something, and they fixed it. No questions asked. Like badasses.

What are the Best Enterprise-Level Hosting Plans for WordPress?
They pride themselves on their platform being secure, scalable, and providing great performance. On the enterprise-level end of the spectrum (as they have entry-level setups as well), their hosting plans are fully customizable, allowing each customer to build their own hosting solution depending on their needs.

Scott Beale, Founder of Laughing Squid
First thing Pressable’s team asked for was feedback, and we provided it. Less than 24 hours later, the feature we requested was live! Needless to say, our team was thrilled!
Scott Herring, Lead Dog at Twisted Puppy
Pressable has been a game changer for our agency clients. We’ve been using another service provider for many years, mainly because the price was right and the tools were better than others. But Pressable has all that and REAL support by REAL people. Simple setup, quick responses to questions and 10X faster performance awaited our first migration. Oh, and that Pressable migration was a snap. We recommend Pressable to all our clients as the first choice for managed WordPress hosting.
Evan, Websites That Don’t Suck
Pressable sales support got back [to me] and answered my question perfectly and succinctly. I will be converting all of my clients’ sites to Pressable because of the support!
HostReview
Pressable has been selected by HostReview’s award panel as one of the best companies of 2018 in the Best WordPress Hosting category.
Rufus Denne, Flank
We’ve been using Pressable since we started because they’re great value for money, which is still true – but it is not the reason we’re still a customer. We stay for the amazing customer support, growing feature set (and free tee shirts)!
WP Buffs
Pressable is easily one of our favorite partners to work with. We’re extremely value-driven here at WP Buffs so any business or individual we decide to work with needs to be on the same page as us in that sense. The Pressable team has been nothing but fantastic to work with and their team is driven by happy customers and taking strides forward in the WordPress space. We couldn’t ask for a better company to work with
StagingPilot
Pressable is one of the best kept secrets for agencies and freelancers looking to grow their business. A quality partner to have in your corner – at a killer price. Combining Pressable + StagingPilot empowers agencies to build substantial recurring revenue by white-labeling and bundling hosting & maintenance services for their clients.
FreshySites
We have spent hundreds of hours researching the very best infrastructure provider for our 1,000+ WordPress installs and landed at Pressable. We have been thrilled with everything about the platform, from amazing speed, to super solid stability, to the best WordPress Hosting support team we’ve ever interacted with. These guys are the real deal. Since making the switch we have never looked back and are looking forward to a great long term relationship with the folks at Pressable.
