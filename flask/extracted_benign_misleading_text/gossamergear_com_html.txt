Since 1998
We take pride in creating some of the most innovative gear on the market while teaching and advocating for lightweight backpacking. Take Less. Do more.
Our ultralight backpacks hit that sweet spot where capacity, durability and lightweight come together.
For mountain-goat level agility on the trail, try our trekking poles, the lightest on the market.
Our ultra-light shelters shield you from the elements while minimizing the wear and tear of heavy pack weight
