Arts and Culture at Laurentian University
#LUartscultureUL
Laurentian University is host to many arts and cultural events, activities, and groups. Our tricultural mandate values university experiences in both English and French, while promoting Indigenous perspectives and cross-cultural understanding.
We draw in the Sudbury community with our numerous events hosted at our campus and the downtown McEwen School of Architecture, and bring recognition to Laurentian through our partnerships with other events and venues around the city.
It's all here.
More students are choosing Laurentian and we are excited to let you know why. We have award winning programs, a multi-cultural learning atmosphere, and a breath-taking campus. We have a proven track record in preparing graduates for a bright and rewarding future.
Laurentian University Strategic Plan 2018-2023
#Imagine2023 is about demonstrating the shared values and strengths that make us who we are. They are impressive on their own, but taken together, they tell a powerful story about who we are and all we have to offer.
Our plan is a reflection of our students, faculty, and staff, their work, and the positive impact Laurentian will continue to make in the world. Together, we will shape the future.
