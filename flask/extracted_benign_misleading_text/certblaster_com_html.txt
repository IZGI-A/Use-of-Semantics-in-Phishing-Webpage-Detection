Security+ Exam SY0-301 vs SY0-401 Exam Objectives
How different is the new Security+ SY0-401 compared to the old SY0-301?
The Security+ Nouveau has arrived! However, would you be so inclined, you will still be able to sit for the “old” SY0-301 until December 31 of 2014.
The new material in CompTIA’s Certification Exam Objectives for Security+ SY0-401center mostly around the Cloud, mobile and the challenges posed to internal security when allowing third party access.
They say you can make statistics say whatever you want it to say and that holds, to a certain extent, true when it comes to analyzing the difference between the new Security+ and the old one.
A superficial look will make the changes seem very minor. You still have the exact same number of main domain, six. They are labelled exactly the same as before and the difference in how they are weighed at the exam is within a couple of percent or so compared to the old exam. Security+ SY0-401 has six main domains and a total of 33 sub domains in all. Of these 33 sub domains only four are completely new and these are:
2.2 Summarize the security implications of integrating systems and data with third parties.
2.9 Given a scenario, select the appropriate control to meet the goals of security.
4.2 Summarize mobile security concepts and technologies.
4.5 Compare and contrast alternative methods to mitigate security risks in static environments.
So four new sub domains out of 33 and were looking at just a bit over 12% added content to cover, right? Wrong, because here, as in so many other situations, the devil is in the details.
Looking closer you will notice that (including the four all new sub-domains) 22 out of the 33 sub-domains in SY0-401 have seen some content added. Now we are looking a 66% difference! This of course is going a bit far in the other direction but does demonstrate that a superficial analysis, is yet again, not going to give you the whole story. So we have to look beyond just the sub-domain level. Just for clarity here is how the terminology works:
|Example of CompTIA objectives listing
|Our terminology
|1.4 Given a scenario, implement common protocols and services.
|Sub-domain
|• Protocols
|Topic
|o IPSec
|Sub-topic
We prefer “Main-objective” for the top level objective and “Sub-objective” instead of Sub-domain. However, in the interest of clarity and minimum confusion, we use “Domain” because that is what CompTIA uses in their “Certification Exam Objectives” document. To get these documents click on the following links: Exam Objectives for SY0-301 and SY0-401.
So back to our analysis, the new exam objectives have a total of 307 Topic items and 339 sub-topics. How many of those are new? There are in all 61 Topic items and 128 new sub-topics. This means that 20% of the Topics are new while 36 of the Sub-topics are new. This is quite significant. The exam has a maximum of 90 questions, with 128 new sub-topics you could arguably (although agreed, that would be extreme) sit for an exam that has none of the content of the “old” SY0-301 exam. Here is another superficial fact, but this may not lead to the wrong conclusion, the Certification Exam Objectives for SY0-301 is 16 pages while the new Certification Exam Objectives document for SY0-401 is 23 pages long…
