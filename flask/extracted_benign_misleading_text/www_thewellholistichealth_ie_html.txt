How I work
I work with people who are looking for physical and mental healthcare solutions which are affordable, effective and without harmful side effects. Treatment is aimed as getting to the root of the problem to create lasting improvements in health. Homeopathy is a branch of complementary medicine used by millions of people worldwide, using natural remedies to support and facilitate healing. It can work rapidly for acute conditions such as minor illness and first aid situations. For recurring or chronic conditions, several treatments at monthly intervals may be necessary, depending on the person. Consultations provide you with a safe, supportive space to explore your health concerns and hopes for the future. Together we can identify the main issues and I can suggest a treatment plan which will be carefully tailored to your specific needs.
I work with all ages, from newborns to the elderly. Homeopathy is both gentle and powerful, and can be used alongside conventional medicine. Always consult your GP.
"The highest ideal of cure is rapid, gentle and permanent restoration of health... in the shortest, most reliable, and most harmless way."
Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, Founder of Homeopathy
