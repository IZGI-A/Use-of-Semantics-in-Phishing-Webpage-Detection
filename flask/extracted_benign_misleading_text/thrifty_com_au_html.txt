There's a reason your car might not be clean on the outside
Much of NSW is now in drought. In some areas water levels are so low that strict water restrictions are in place. Thrifty like most of the community understands the need to conserve what little water remains at any cost. As a result, until these restrictions are lifted we are unable to wash our vehicles at a few key locations including Gunnedah, Tamworth, Armidale & Bathurst. We are very sorry for the inconvenience this may cause and trust you understand the reason. Rest assured we will still ensure our vehicles are roadworthy and sound, with clean interiors.
Please remember that driving in dusty drought conditions can be dangerous. Please slow down and stay safe during this difficult time.
