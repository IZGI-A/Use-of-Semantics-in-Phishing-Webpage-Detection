This is hard working people, growing families and communities that look out for each other.
This is celebrating life and Friday night lights
This is hope, heart and heroes
This is who we are and this is how we lift each other up. From West Shore to Wyomissing, the hospitals of Penn State Health, including Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and St. Joseph Medical Center, have been here for generations caring for our communities.
This is where journeys begin.
This is where families find strength. And where every moment is another milestone.
From the little league outfielder with a bright blue arm cast, to a teen athlete with a warrior’s heart, Penn State Children’s Hospital has cared for the children of our communities for decades, and will continue to do so for many more.
This is where science confronts cancer.
This is where treatment is game-changing. Where research drives results. And where the will to fight is equaled by the strength of our resolve.
From a coach who beat cancer to a mother in miraculous remission, Penn State Cancer Institute is where we offer the region’s most clinical trials a where new treatments are developed every day.
This is where family comes first - where hard work means everything, and neighbors lend a helping hand. This is where cooperation and teamwork make us better.
Penn State Health is dedicated to doing what is right for our patients and their families.
From building a community health network for easier access, to partnering with Highmark for greater coverage and improved value, our goal is keeping the people of our communities healthy so they can live the way they want. This is why we’re continuing to innovate, and to expand and invest in the areas we serve, the conditions we treat and the people we care for.
