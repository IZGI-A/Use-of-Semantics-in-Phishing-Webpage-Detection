Welcome to A Fistful of Comics, your online comic destination! We deal in new comics via mail-order, back issues, sets, and variants on our eBay store, as well as trades and exclusives right here on our website. You may have also seen us at a convention selling bags & boards and print protectors. We offer a wide variety of services in which you can partake!
If you're interested in our latest exclusive, you can click on that picture in the top left-hand corner of the page and go right to our shop. Interested in mail-order comics but want more information? You can go to our SUBSCRIPTION page for more. Looking for trades that aren't listed in our store? Shoot us an EMAIL telling us what you're looking for. If we don't have it, we can probably get it (at a discounted price to you). Interested in statues, gaming supplies, and apparel? Ask us about that too!
