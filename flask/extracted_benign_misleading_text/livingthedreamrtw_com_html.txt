Welcome to Living the Dream! I'm Jeremy, a full-time blogger based in Pittsburgh. I've been sharing travel, lifestyle design, and blogging tips on this site for over a decade, and in that time I've visited 70+ countries all over the world.
Throw in stories from guest authors, staff writers, and my favorite travel partner Angie (my wife), and we've featured stories from every continent!
What You'll Find on Living the Dream
At its core, Living the Dream is a travel blog- one that focuses on tips and advice, adventure activities, and food and beverage from around the world. While we love to visit unusual destinations, we're also not shy about visiting conventional spots too!
In the past 10 years I've hiked to Everest Base Camp, marveled at the moai of Easter Island, splurged out on points in the Seychelles, visited the mountain gorillas of Uganda, gone scuba diving in the Galapagos, and even scored French Laundry reservations. These are just a few of the numerous activities featured on this site, with more being added every single month!
Since then, the site has expanded to provide lifestyle design and blogging tips. The goal? To help others who are looking to achieve financial independence via blogging just like I did in 2018. All-in-all, Living the Dream features everything I do to live my dreams, plus providing all the tips you need in order to live yours! So I have to ask, where will your dreams take you?
