Without FN, I would still be wondering where the shows are, it's great to be a part of this, I have made my money back a thousand times over.
Having used FestivalNet for 10+ years, it saves me the stress of looking for venues, gives information enabling me to make "intelligent" decisions on which festivals to attend, helps me keep track of where I'm going and where I want to go, the reviews are a huge help & I have event contacts at my finger tips. I have NEVER had any problems getting a response back from this company & I would NEVER think of changing. FestivalNet has proven to me they are one of the very few reputable companies left out there.
THE go-to source for the Pro Artist, Crafter, Musician, Band, Performer, Exhibitor or Food Vendor. Extensive show details, Booking Tools & Market Exposure. Join Now!
