Rousseau Law Firm
Insurance companies are in business to collect premiums and protect their bottom line, not to pay out personal injury claims. We know this because we use to represent insurance companies – we know how the other side thinks. Because the odds are often stacked against injured victims and families in the legal system, working with an experienced personal injury lawyer familiar with Alabama law can make the difference in your case. At Rousseau Law Firm, I’ve made that difference for hundreds of clients. I’m ready to help you level the playing field.
Let me make the difference for you. Contact a Dothan Alabama personal injury lawyer for a FREE case review.
