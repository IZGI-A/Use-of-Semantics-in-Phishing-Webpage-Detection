Dear Spelling Classroom,
During the 2018/2019 school year, I purchased Spelling Classroom program for my students. The program was easy for me to navigate, from adding my students to putting in weekly spelling words. I used your program during our reading RtI time, my students looked forward to the time in this center. My students worked diligently practicing their spelling words for the week. This program allowed them to be held accountable with Hear it, Say it, Write it. In this task your program allowed the students to hear the spelling words read to them, then they had to say the word, and then write each word and turn their paper in. Then the students could choose another practice task to do for the remainder of their time. For example: Word Jumble; several of my students struggled with spelling, but throughout the year their spelling scores started rising. Thank you for your program!
