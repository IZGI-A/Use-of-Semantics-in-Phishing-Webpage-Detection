Hi Derrick. Sometimes high heat or humidity can result in tablets sticking together. They are still safe to consume, but we'd love to replace them for you! Can you please email this photos as well as the lot code from the bottom of the tubes to info@nuunlife.com?

Best hydration products!
Review by Megan V. on 11 Jul 2019
I absolutely love nuun hydration products!!!!!!!! They are effective and most taste wonderful!!! They offer a different twist with the bubbles and do not taste full of “syrup”. The fact that they are certified clean sport is just another plus! Fruit punch is my absolute favorite!!

Review by Hans F. on 22 Jun 2019
I love the simple measuring, carrying, and superior ingredients in NUUN. So, snap, fast to just drop a tablet in any vessel. I know that my endeavors all go better when I’m hydrated.

Lemon Lime Hydration Tablets are my favorite flavor period!
Review by CURTIS D. on 4 Oct 2019
The tablets dissolve perfectly in my bottle of water, making a wonderfully refreshing drink to re-hydrate after my workout session. Without the heavy sugar, this is the way to go, and the only electrolyte supplement I recommend to my contemporaries. Another great product!
