The Fourth Annual Runaway Open was held Saturday, August 31st, at Willis Case Golf Course in Denver, Colorado. From 84 registered players, we had 5 last-day cancellations and 3 no-shows - but 6 called-in from a waiting list and 1 walk-up, for a balance of 83 players on the course. Everyone had a great time raising thousands of dollars for music education, and we're finally reporting back on the tournament results.
All players received a gift bag with an event golf shirt plus items donated by fourteen sponsors, including Phish, LivePhish/Nugs.net, PhanArt, PunkYourFace, Surrender to the Flow, Tropicana Atlantic City, Roboworm, and 4imprint. Through systematic random drawings for player numbers and prize numbers, we also gave away 13 prizes donated by J2G Live, Stranahan's Whiskey, LivePhish, Vincent Romeo Rodriguez, and a Tennessee engraver whose grandfather was a music educator. In total, gifts and prizes averaged nearly $170 per player, not including on-course prizes - for an entry donation of only $150!

To win, be the first person to identify the songs and dates of both mystery clips. The clips are connected by a theme, but the theme needn't be part of the correct answer.

Welcome to the 391st edition of Phish.Net's Mystery Jam Monday - Happy Columbus Day (to those who still celebrate it - in the Bay Area we're way too woke for that). This puzzle comes straight from the mind of MJM HoFer @PhreePhish directly into your earholes: our (true) intent is all for your delight. The winner will receive an MP3 download code courtesy of our friends at LivePhish.com / Nugs.Net. To win, be the first person to identify the songs and dates of both mystery clips. The clips are connected by a theme, but the theme needn't be part of the correct answer. Each person gets one guess to start – if no one answers correctly in the first 24 hours, I'll post a hint. After the hint, everyone gets one more guess before Wednesday at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. Good luck!
Hint: You know how sometimes I give away the theme in the intro, but no one notices till after the fact? This is one of those times.
Welcome to the 390th edition of Phish.Net's Mystery Jam Monday, the
first second (technically) and easiest of October. The winner will receive two MP3 download codes courtesy of our friends at LivePhish.com / Nugs.Net and our friend @garcia17, who has tossed his latest code back into the pool for a n00b double down delight this week. To win, be the first person to identify the song and date of the mystery clip. Each person gets one guess to start – if no one answers correctly in the first 24 hours, I'll post a hint. After the hint, everyone gets one more guess before Wednesday at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. Good luck!
Hint: As of 1:40 PM PDT on Tuesday, one of the guesses has the correct song, but every guess is too late in the band's history.
Answer: Congrats to first-time winner, @Zands, who used the hint to quickly find the 11/17/94 "Also Sprach Zarathustra." Stay tuned next week for a double-double: animal style.
We are excited to announce that the Phish.net store now offers blended (50% cotton, 50% poly) Gildan golf shirts with the Mockingbird Foundation logo embroidered on the front breast and "The Mockingbird Foundation" embroidered on the left sleeve. They're available in five sizes, and come in maroon, but limited quantity - we only ordered 25, so act soon. (For completists, watch for two variants: board members have blue, and Runaway Open golfers have green.)
We wanted to make sure you’ve heard about Long May They Run, a new music documentary podcast series from C13Originals, hosted and written by Dean Budnick, editor of Relix (and a veteran Phish fan). The first season of the podcast is about Phish, which is appropriate, because the podcast’s intent is to discuss iconic touring bands who have had a lasting impact on music culture and the music industry. You can listen to the first several episodes of the podcast here on Apple Podcasts: http://bit.ly/LMTRPodcast.
And here is an audio preview clip of the next episode that debuts tomorrow, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019, featuring Trey discussing the improvisational comedy communication concept of "Yes, and---":
Welcome to the 389th edition of Phish.Net's Mystery Jam
Monday Tuesday, the last of September the first of October because I got home so late guy forgot to set it up. The usual "n00bs only for first of the month" stipulation does not apply to this MJM. The winner will receive an MP3 download code courtesy of our friends at LivePhish.com / Nugs.Net. To win, be the first person to identify the song and date of the mystery clip. Each person gets one guess to start – if no one answers correctly in the first 24 hours, I'll post a hint. After the hint, everyone gets one more guess before Wednesday Thursday at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. Good luck!

Welcome to the 388th edition of Phish.Net's Mystery Jam Monday, the
last penultimate and most difficult of September. The winner will receive an MP3 download code courtesy of our friends at LivePhish.com / Nugs.Net. To win, be the first person to identify the songs and dates of all three mystery clips. The clips are connected by a theme, but the theme needn't be part of the correct answer. Each person gets one guess to start – if no one answers correctly in the first 24 hours, I'll post a hint. After the hint, everyone gets one more guess before Wednesday at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. Good luck!
Are you a huge Trey Anastasio Band fan or live in the Louisville, Kentucky area? If not, chances are you had no idea TAB played for an hour last night at the Bourbon & Beyond Festival. It’s possible it’s the most random date on Trey’s playing calendar this year. It was his first time performing in public in the three weeks since Dick’s, and his solo tour doesn’t begin for another three weeks either.
While some nights of the Baker’s Dozen had unexpected twists and turns and surprising covers, there were probably two nights that had the most predictable songs performed for the theme of night: "Cinnamon Girl" on Cinnamon Night and a Jimi Hendrix song on Jimmies Night. You could definitely make an argument for “Powderfinger” on Powdered Night but let’s not digress....
Phish is no stranger to covering the Beatles. They famously covered The Beatles, (also known as “The White Album”) in 1994 to kick off their impressive Halloween history of having musical “costumes” and covering classic albums from the past, their own future, and even from the imaginary past of an obscure Scandinavian band. Subsequent to that fateful night in Glens Falls when the band performed all 30 songs off of the ninth studio album of the English rock band, several other Beatles covers have been performed....

To win, be the first person to identify the songs and dates of both mystery clips. The clips are connected by a theme, but the theme needn't be part of the correct answer.

The Phish.net Store is evolving a bit. We recently added a static-cling version of the Mockingbird sticker, and before that a charcoal version of the "Helping Kids Make Music" shirts. Just days ago, we added "donut pattern" watch straps, in three sizes, donated to the Foundation and now available as a fundraiser for music education.
Meanwhile, as we look ahead and plan some new items, more than half of the current offerings (7 of 13 items) are half-price, including two collectible pins, two versions of the "couch tour" shirt, and an engraved lighter cover priced to move.
More than 40 volunteers are currently reviewing nearly 700 funding inquires to the Mockingbird Foundation, which makes this a doubly great time to pick up some schwag, fly your .net flag, and support music education. We appreciate your support!

Note #1: “Idle Days” is the number of days from the last pre-Dick’s show to the first night of Dick’s. In 2019, it was 47 days from Alpine N3 to Dick’s N1.
Note #2: The average three-night rating for 2019 is based on about 425 reviewers for each show. The value used in this graph (3.967) is likely to change a bit as more people provide a rating.

The Mockingbird Foundation is a non-profit organization founded by Phish fans in 1996 to generate charitable proceeds from the Phish community.
And since we're entirely volunteer – with no office, salaries, or paid staff – administrative costs are less than 2% of revenues! So far, we've distributed just about $1,500,000 to support music education for children – hundreds of grants in all 50 states, with more on the way.
