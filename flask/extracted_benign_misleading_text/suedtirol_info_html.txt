South Tyrol – The other side of Italy
Italy’s northernmost province combines Alpine staidness with Italian joie-de-vivre, the Dolomites – a UNESCO World Heritage site – and cultural diversity. South Tyrol is a region abounding with contrasts, between Mediterranean landscape and Alpine peaks, deeply rooted tradition and cosmopolitan curiosity. The allure of South Tyrol lies in its variety and the harmony of opposites.
