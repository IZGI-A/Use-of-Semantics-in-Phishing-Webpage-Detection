I found the training very useful in gaining relevant information for myself and my organization. In the first place we looked into details of each analysis practically with the motivated staff, highly qualified food scientists and coordinators who managed the schedule effectively within the available time.The experience will be really helpful to select so many sophisticated instruments in our lab when we return to our country! â€“ Mesfin Mezemir Abebe
