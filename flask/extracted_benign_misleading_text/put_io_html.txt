What we are
We fetch files from many public places at very high speeds, then put them into your digital stash.
We are more like the remote version of the "/downloads" directory on your computer. We do the downloading for you and then we serve up the goods to your devices.
What we are not
We are not a backup or syncing service like Dropbox or Google Drive where you upload your own stuff for safekeeping.
We are also not a cyber-locker where you can upload something and make it available to the whole public.
