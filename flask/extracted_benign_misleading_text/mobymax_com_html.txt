To get started after you create your teacher account, first register your children as students. Your children will sign in to do their school work with the username and password you assign. You will sign in as their teacher to monitor and assign their lessons.
For administrative security, we will verify your email address before you can sign in to MobyMax. Please allow 24 hours for us to verify with a telephone call to your office.
We will leave a voice mail message upon verification.
