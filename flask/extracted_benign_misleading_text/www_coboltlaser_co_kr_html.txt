High Performance Lasers by Cobolt
CW and Q-switched DPSS lasers, diode laser modules, fiber pigtailed lasers
Cobolt is at the very forefront of the industry in the development and manufacture of high performance CW and Q-switched lasers. We provide ultra low noise, CW, single mode solid-state lasers in the UV-Visible-NIR spectral range; Q-switched DPSS lasers with the unique combination of high pulse rates and high pulse energy in the UV-NIR range; as well as tunable mid-IR sources. The lasers are manufactured using our unique and proprietary HTCure™ technology yielding unrivaled robustness and reliability.
The combination of uncompromised optical performance with nonpareil tolerance to demanding environmental conditions has made Cobolt lasers the preferred choice by leading instrument manufacturers and scientists worldwide.
