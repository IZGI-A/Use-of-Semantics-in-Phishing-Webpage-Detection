This rally cry was created and developed out of our love for our businesses throughout Hill County. We are pledging to unite as neighbors, friends, coworkers, and community leaders to raise our community... #Raising Hill!
Welcome to #Raising Hill!
While Hill County has fast-paced global business advantages, we are a small Texas county with small "mom and pop" run businesses that count on local support to continue normal day-to-day operations.

Family
We are a county that focuses on family values, serene living, and encompasses love, compassion, and support.
We thrive with our small businesses and close, county-wide relationships. We understand the importance of #ShoppingLocal.
