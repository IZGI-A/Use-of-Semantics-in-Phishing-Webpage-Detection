Parents Love WriteShop!
My kiddos are having so much fun with the lessons that they actually look forward to writing time now … We’re absolutely loving this program!
If you’re a homeschooler {or even a classroom teacher} and are looking for a writing curriculum. One word: WriteShop.
No matter what we’re studying each year, we always have to include WriteShop books in our curriculum lineup!
Thanks for the thought and care you’ve put into preparing and publishing WriteShop. It is absolutely the best writing program on the homeschool market.
My daughter adores this writing program, and so do I. The gentle nature, hands-on activities…and opportunity to work with mom make an irresistible combination for her.
I have loved working on this fun curriculum with my daughter. Best of all I have enjoyed watching her enthusiasm and talent for writing grow!
WriteShop is the most complete, fun and effective writing program we have found, and it makes teaching writing ‘do-able’ for me! Thank you again … and again!
WriteShop has been a wonderful program for us. I don’t think my dyslexic daughter would have ever learned to write without it!
WriteShop has changed my little boy into a writer … I am just so happy that he is excited about writing!
Ella begs me to do this book with her! …WriteShop [Primary] has helped her to find a focus in her writing. As a result of using this book, she wants to write every day!
WriteShop has helped me become a better teacher, and my son’s writing has improved a lot this year.
As a parent of a struggling 3rd grade writer, I am so excited about this program! The ideas in Book B … were exactly what he needed to succeed.
I can’t tell you how instrumental WriteShop has been to help my dear son break through some really tough writing walls.
Every WriteShop product tried by our family has been fabulous.
My daughter thinks that the product is wonderful. It’s a fun and creative curriculum that allowed her to grow as a writer.
Takes the groaning and moaning out of reluctant … writers.
I used WriteShop for two years with my oldest when she needed to seriously learn to write. I had felt so helpless and clueless, but WriteShop gave me just the right tools.
