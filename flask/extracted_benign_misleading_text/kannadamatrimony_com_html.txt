About KannadaMatrimony
If you are looking for Kannada brides
and Kannada grooms
, look no further than KannadaMatrimony.
Kannadiga weddings closely resemble the traditional Hindu wedding. However, there are still several rituals and traditions which are unique to a Kannadiga wedding; Kashi yatra is one such tradition, wherein the groom pretends to leave for the city of Kashi as he has not found a suitable bride. His maternal uncle coaxes him into staying back by showing him the picture of the bride.
During the wedding, the couple exchanges garlands, followed by Dhare Herdu, during which the bride's parents give her away to the groom. The wedding ceremony is complete after the Saptapadi ceremony where the couple takes seven rounds around the sacred fire.
