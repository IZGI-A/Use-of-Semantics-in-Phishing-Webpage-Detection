Equal parts big adventure and simple living, Bedrock Sandals® are freedom footwear for the great outdoors. Our industry-leading designs help you securely move from mountain tops to river bottoms, and everywhere in between. Ready to Bedrock?
From trail to river to everything in between, the Cairn is built for all adventures.
From our award-winning Cairn design, we’ve added a sculpted footbed that is secure, lightweight, and loaded for the long haul.
Bedrock began in 2011 with our classic ultralight + huarache-inspired sport sandals.
From our roots in river conservation to our mission of defining the modern adventure sandal, the Bedrock story continues to evolve.
