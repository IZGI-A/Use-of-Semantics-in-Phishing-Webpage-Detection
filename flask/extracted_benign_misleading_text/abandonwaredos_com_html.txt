To abandonware or not?
Where does the love for old abandoned games comes from? Our childhood, perhaps. What's left of that age? What do we miss so much? The long afternoons spent walking in the worlds of Ultima or the hours passed impersonating Duke Nukem. Here we are now, slightly aged, eager to pay homage to all those wonderful DOS games.
After all, it's about passion and remembering.
The games listed here are no longer supported by their respective developers (as far as I know). If you find out that a game is still on sale or "protected", please let me know and I'll remove it from Abandonware DOS as soon as possible.
