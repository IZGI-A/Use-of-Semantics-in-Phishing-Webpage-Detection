Good news, you can now get access to the internal BT job board. Here you’ll be able to find hundreds of potential opportunities, not only here in the UK but across the globe. So, if you’ve already had an eye on the EE Support Office, you’ll now have an even better chance of finding the perfect fit for your next career move.
Could you be the next Openreach Engineer in the UK, Project Manager in Australia or maybe your next role could be with BT Sport? Who knows, the world of BT is your oyster.

EE is now part of the BT family. That means that you might find yourself switching from EE to BT or vice versa. We want to make that process as smooth as possible, so we’ve created a series of documents that explain what moving will mean for you.
