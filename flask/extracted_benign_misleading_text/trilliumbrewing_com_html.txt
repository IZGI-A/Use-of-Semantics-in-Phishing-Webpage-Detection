Trillium Brewing Company was founded by JC and Esther Tetreault, a young dumb couple in love, planning their wedding and dreaming about how they would spend their lives together. The desire to build a brewery was about more than just making beer, it was about creating a way of life and building a community with which to share experiences. A beer geek and botany nerd, JC chose the trillium flower to represent what we strive to bring to our beer and our lives: beauty, strength, simplicity, and balance.
