ABOUT ME
I'm a little 12 pound rescue pup. My mama rescued me out of Texas without even meeting me. She had been searching for a rescue dog and when she saw my picture, she just knew I was the one! When she brought me home, I sniffed the whole apartment and then plopped down in her lap, and I've basically never left.
As much as I love to be cuddled up on the sofa with Mama, my next favorite thing is to be out exploring the great outdoors. I may be tiny, but I can still go on big adventures! I love to hike and I'm learning to enjoy swimming. Mama works on my off leash recall a lot so I can hike off leash whenever possible. I can't decide which is my favorite part: smelling all the smells or getting dirty walking in the mud and rolling in all the stinky things. When we can't adventure in the great outdoors, we explore everything our city has to offer!
We post about raw feeding, doggy fashion, and our adventures. We also love to raise awareness around topics like environmental activism, social change advocacy, and living with chronic illnesses.
