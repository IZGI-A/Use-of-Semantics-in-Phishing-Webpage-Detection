- Save time!
With a finite supply of and seemingly infinite demand for your time, each minute you save is one more you can spend crafting the perfect lesson, helping a student grasp a difficult concept, or finding time to just breathe. When it comes to learning math, practice makes perfect, but finding the right practice takes time. You can waste countless hours hunting for the right problems and come up empty-handed. This is where we can help. You no longer need to search to the end of the Internet, or through a stack of textbooks. In just a few minutes, you can create the questions you need with the properties you want.
- Individualize, Differentiate, Customize!
More than just buzz words, adapting to students' skills and learning styles provides a powerful sense of ownership of the learning process that can have lasting effects. Our programs enable you to do the previously impossible: customizable homework, quizzes, and tests in a fraction of the time! Students and curriculum can change drastically from year to year, and your assessments should be as adaptable as you need to be.
- Pick up where your textbook left off!
Even the most comprehensive textbooks are forced to restrict the amount of time dedicated to any given topic. Our programs take your options and create the questions you want, on your computer, rather than selecting problems from a prewritten set. This allows them to create as many questions as possible in the blink of an eye. Now, you can finish a topic when your students have mastered it, not when you run out of problems. Crafting your own assignments means that you know the exact difficulty of each problem before it is printed, and you can tailor your assignments to each lesson or student instead of piecing together lessons around preset assessments.
