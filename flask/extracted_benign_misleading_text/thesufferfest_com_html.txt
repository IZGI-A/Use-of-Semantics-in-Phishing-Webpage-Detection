STORYLINES & MUSIC THAT DRAW YOU IN
Riding inside doesn't have to suck. Every workout has its own story, with arch rivals, epic battles, and nail-biting sprint finishes. Pair that with killer soundtracks and you'll almost forget how much it hurts.
"If you haven't tried The Sufferfest, you're missing out. The best money I spend a month. The pro racing videos laced with motivational name-calling is pretty much the best thing ever."
"This highly regarded indoor cycling app offers a vast collection of cycling training videos compelling storylines and heart-pumping soundtracks."—Huffington Post
Four-Dimensional Power™: The Most Effective Workouts Available
4DP™ will change the way you train. Our comprehensive fitness test goes beyond FTP, using four distinct metrics to reveal who you are as a cyclist and personalize every target in your workouts to match your unique profile. No other training app can do that.
-
Find Your Hidden Power
4DP™ measures your neuromuscular power (NM), Anaerobic Capacity (AC), Maximal Aerobic (MAP) and Functional Threshold Power (FTP) to determine what you’re capable of across a range of efforts. The app will then assign you a rider type—Sprinter, Attacker, Pursuiter, Time Triallist, Climber, or Rouleur—and personalise your power targets to match your unique profile. Specific workout recommendations will help build your strengths and address your weaknesses.
-
Your Targets, Your Workouts
Training apps that just use FTP to set power targets are just guessing what you can do. 4DP™ knows exactly what you’re capable of across a range of efforts and uses your complete power profile to tailor every target in every workout. You get the precise training stimulus necessary to get faster. No more wasting time on workouts that don’t work.
-
Race Proven
4DP™ uses the same testing and workout personalization protocol developed by world-class coach Neal Henderson to train his elite athletes. Grounded in cutting-edge sports science, verified by rigorous lab testing, and proven by victories in the most prestigious events in the world such as the Tour de France, World Championships and the Olympics. 4DP™ puts race-winning, individually-optimized training in your hands.

Getting fast isn’t just about training on the bike. Our plans integrate structured cycling workouts, full-body yoga sessions, strength training, and mental toughness exercises to make you strong, flexible, focused, and mentally tough. The competition doesn’t have a chance.
“I started suffering regularly 3 months ago. 19lbs lost, and 20-minute power increase from 2.6 to 3 w/kg after finishing the novice training plan. Thanks Minions!”—Dwayne Primeau
“Short, sharp and to the point. Effective training in minimum time. Humorous while making you hurt.”—Manny Nisbet
YOGA FOR CYCLISTS
Getting faster on the bike means getting stronger off it. Our Yoga for Cyclists videos, created with Abi Carver at Yoga15.com, will help you build core strength and flexibility, improve your posture, reduce the chance of injury, and help you stay calm and focused under pressure. Come for the Suffering, Namaste for the yoga.
-
15 MINUTES OR LESS
Our workouts are designed to give you maximum benefit with minimum time. So is our yoga progamme. Most of the sessions are 15 minutes or less, making them perfect for the time-crunched athlete looking to improve full-body strength and flexibility. You get straight to the exercises that matter, without having to stare at some stranger’s Downward Dog in a crowded yoga studio.
-
ALL PART OF THE PLAN
To help you get the most out of your training, we integrated the Yoga for Cyclists Programme into all of our training plans. Pre and post-workout yoga sessions target your Core, Flexibility, Posture, Recovery, and Breathing so you can maximise your Return on Suffering. The Travel sessions will make sure you stay strong in Couchlandria.
-
STRONG TO THE CORE
The 30 sessions included with the app are designed to strengthen notoriously weak areas for cyclists: your core, back, upper body and overall flexibility. Other sessions help you improve your balance, your agility and your posture. Feeling stressed or fatigued? The recovery and breathing sessions will make you feel right at Om.
MENTAL TOUGHNESS
Courage and fear. Confidence and doubt. Winning and losing. The difference, more often than not, is a state of mind. Developed with sports psychologists and elite coaches, our new mental toughness Programme brings you practical, no-nonsense tools to build your mental toughness.
-
Improve athletic performance
Legs alone can't get you where you're going. Whether you're gunning for the top of the podium or the top of the local climb, the stuff that really counts is right under your helmet.
-
10 week programme of modules
Over the course of 20 audio modules you’ll learn practical techniques that will help you identify who you are as an athlete, what you want, and exactly how to get it.
