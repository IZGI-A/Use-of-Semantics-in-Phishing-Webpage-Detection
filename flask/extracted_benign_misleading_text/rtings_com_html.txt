Unlike most websites, we do not get our review units directly from the manufacturers. Instead, we buy everything ourselves, like a normal customer. It means our units aren't cherry-picked by the manufacturers, but actually represent what you would buy.
We put all the products we review under the same test bench, so they are easily comparable. Even our pictures are taken in a systematic way. We spend a lot of time comparing the products side-by-side to validate our results. Our test methodology is also on our website so you can confirm the results yourself.
We keep the products that we review until they are discontinued, so we can go back and compare them to ensure our reviews are still accurate. All our ratings are automatically calculated based on our test measurements, which are designed to match what really matters to a customer.
