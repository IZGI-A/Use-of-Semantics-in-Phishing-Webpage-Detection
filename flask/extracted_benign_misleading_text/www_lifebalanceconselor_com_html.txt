My life experiences and adventures led me to a life I have never dreamt of. I tried to push certain things away, but only when I accepted them and realized their potential, I bloomed into the person I am today. I want to help you achieve the same.
My goal is to motivate you to heal and work on your growth and self-development to achieve your fullest potential. I will guide you and provide you with resources and strategies, and help you find internal motivation. You are capable of doing all the work by yourself. Reach out to me if you need help in any of these areas:
● Help you to understand what your body and soul need
● Increasing your self-love and self-worth
● Finding purpose, motivation, or positivity, and staying accountable
● Improving your lifestyle and health issues
● Lowering stress and anxiety
● Improving and forming relationships
● Coping with negative situations or people and loneliness
● Dealing with stress from job interview, school exams, public speech
● Grief and stress management
● Regular exercises for the back, bones, joints, balance
After our session i feel so positive minded, stress free and full of power to deal with every day problems. Thank you for cleaning up my head!

Miriam helped me to sort out my personal related issues. Thanks to her advice and support, I dealt with life after my mother's death and ended a long-term relationship much easier. Nowadays, I am delighted that I have a husband, a child, and finally settled and comfortable. She is still my first help when any working or personal struggle appears in my life. Thank you, Miriam!"

..in this difficult time, this is a great opportunity to return from negative thoughts to a positive perception of oneself. Great that there are people who have a different view of everything that happens to us and around us. Only when a person feels what is told to him do real miracles happen.
From a person who has experienced it and is experiencing it firsthand.
