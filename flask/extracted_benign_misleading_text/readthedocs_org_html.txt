Technical documentation lives here
Read the Docs simplifies software documentation by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you.
Free docs hosting
We will host your documentation for free forever. There are no tricks. We help tens of thousands of open source projects share their docs.
Webhooks
Whenever you push code to your favorite version control system, whether that is Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Subversion, we will automatically build your docs so your code and documentation are never out of sync.
Multiple formats
Of course we build and host your docs for the web, but they are also vieweable as PDFs, as single page HTML, and for eReaders. No additional configuration is required.
Multiple versions
We can host and build multiple versions of your docs so having a 1.0 version of your docs and a 2.0 version of your docs is as easy as having a separate branch or tag in your version control system.
