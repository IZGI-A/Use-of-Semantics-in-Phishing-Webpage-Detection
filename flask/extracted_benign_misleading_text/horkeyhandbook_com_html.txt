I’m Gina Horkey – since 2014 I’ve been helping people start and grow their own freelance writing and virtual assistant businesses by openly sharing my own journey.
Why? In May of 2014, I decided to start my own side hustle offering writing and email management services. And within a few months I was earning $4,000 per month (in addition to my day job income!), working full-time and raising 2 toddlers.
It wasn’t much later that I gave my boss the “pink slip” and became a full-time webpreneur. You too can start living the life you want, without having to be filthy rich or waiting to retire.
