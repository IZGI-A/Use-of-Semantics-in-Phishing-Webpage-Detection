Continual process improvement on 10 nm photomask manufacturing in clean module
Designed and implemented process change that eliminated killer defect on production and removed unnecessary containment step in the manufacturing flow.
Achieved 75% yield improvement on 10 nm mask repell process.
Photomask manufacturing tool sustaining
Resolved an extended down time (>1 year) on one tool set by developing novel partitioning methods for defect troubleshooting. 100x defect level reduction and matching to the best performance tool.
Gained critical tool redundancy and >95 % availability to support high manufacturing volume.
Managed multiple projects working closely with 3rd party international vendors for hardware/software improvement, replacement and upgrades.
Served as a module representative in the inter-module task force team on back-end photomask manufacturing process. Responded to any yield related issues in daily basis and communicated with multiple modules for tactical reactions.
