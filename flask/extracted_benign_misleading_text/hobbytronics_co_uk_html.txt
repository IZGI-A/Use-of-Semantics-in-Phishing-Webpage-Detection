We are sad to announce we have taken the decision to cease trading in the next few months. Exact timing will depend on the stock levels but this means, when it is gone – it is gone.
We would like to thank all our customers, new and old, for being such a pleasure to deal with. Please be assured that we will continue to handle your orders as efficiently and conscientiously as we have always done in the past. It is business as usual for the time being but we wanted to explain the reducing stock levels.
