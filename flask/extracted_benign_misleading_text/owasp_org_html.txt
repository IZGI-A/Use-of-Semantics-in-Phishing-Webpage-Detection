the free and open software security community

|Every vibrant technology marketplace needs an unbiased source of information on best practices as well as an active body advocating open standards. In the Application Security space, one of those groups is the Open Web Application Security Projectâ„¢ (or OWASP for short).
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a 501(c)(3) worldwide not-for-profit charitable organization focused on improving the security of software. Our mission is to make software security visible, so that individuals and organizations are able to make informed decisions. OWASP is in a unique position to provide impartial, practical information about AppSec to individuals, corporations, universities, government agencies, and other organizations worldwide. Operating as a community of like-minded professionals, OWASP issues software tools and knowledge-based documentation on application security.
Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license. You'll find everything about OWASP here on or linked from our wiki and current information on our OWASP Blog. OWASP does not endorse or recommend commercial products or services, allowing our community to remain vendor neutral with the collective wisdom of the best minds in software security worldwide.
We ask that the community look out for inappropriate uses of the OWASP brand including use of our name, logos, project names, and other trademark issues.
There are thousands of active wiki users around the globe who review the changes to the site to help ensure quality. If you're new, you may want to check out our getting started page. As a global group of volunteers with over 45,000 participants, questions or comments should be sent to one of our many mailing lists focused on a topic or directed to the staff using the OWASP Contact Us Form.

Flagship Projects
Projects that have demonstrated strategic value to OWASP and application security as a whole
Automatically finds security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications
A collection of easy-to-use application security tools and documentation available in multiple formats
Pentesting tool to more efficiently find, verify and combine vulnerabilities in short timeframes
A utility that identifies project dependencies and checks if there are any known, publicly disclosed, vulnerabilities
A web and mobile application security training platform to foster and improve security awareness among a varied skill-set demographic
An open source vulnerability management tool that streamlines the testing process by offering templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline self-service tools
An intentionally insecure webapp for security trainings written entirely in JavaScript which encompasses the entire OWASP Top Ten and other severe security flaws
A tool that is used as a guide for building and verifying secure software that can also be used to train developers about application security
A Software Composition Analysis (SCA) platform that keeps track of all third-party components used in all the applications an organization creates or consumes. It monitors all applications in its portfolio in order to proactively identify vulnerabilities in components that are placing your applications at risk
A set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls which aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks
A library that implements a variant of the synchronizer token pattern to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
Provides a basis for testing web application technical security controls and also provides developers with a list of requirements for secure development
A conceptual framework and methodology that offers prescriptive guidance to implement intrusion detection and automated response into applications
An open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization
A powerful awareness document for web application security that represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications
Includes a "best practice" penetration testing framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a "low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques for testing most common web application and web service security issues
The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series was created to provide a concise collection of high value information on specific application security topics. These cheat sheets were created by various application security professionals who have expertise in specific topics.
A security standard for mobile apps and a comprehensive testing guide that covers the processes, techniques, and tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results.
