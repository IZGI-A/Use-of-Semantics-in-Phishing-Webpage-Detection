In April, a book entitled "A Road Map for Respect, Kindness, Gratitude, Grit, Courage and Resilience" was published. This book is the outcome of a collaborative writing process within the Montville Township Schools and features the work of more than 125 student authors. As part of the district's Character Education and Mindfulness Initiatives, students and the superintendent of schools share their perspectives on a variety of topics which reinforce the importance of respect, kindness, gratitude, grit, courage and resilience in our daily lives. Students from the elementary through high school levels contributed their wisdom and thoughts on these important topics.
The book is available through Amazon for $5.00. Proceeds go to the Montville Township Public Schools.
