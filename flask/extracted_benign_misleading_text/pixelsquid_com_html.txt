What are PixelSquid 3D Objects?
PixelSquid is a library of design-ready 3D objects that you can easily use in your graphic design projects and workflow. Search our growing catalog to find the object you need, spin it to get the perfect angle, then immediately download it as a PNG with a perfectly transparent background or as a layered PSD file.
Join PixelSquid Today
There are three easy (and affordable) ways to join PixelSquid and instantly gain access to our entire library of 3D objects. The Starter Plan is perfect for designers who occasionally need a handful of objects or want to test out watermarked objects, whereas the Monthly and Annual plans are ideal for designers who want ongoing, unlimited access to the entire catalog.
Not ready to decide? That's OK. You can still download watermarked versions of our objects straight from the catalog.
