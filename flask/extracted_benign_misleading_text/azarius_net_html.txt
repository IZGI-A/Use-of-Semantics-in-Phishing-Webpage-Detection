Azarius is an online Smartshop & Headshop.
We give people access to plants, herbs, supplements and seeds from all over the world. Many of these natural products provide amazing, sometimes life-altering experiences.
Azarius started back in 1999 as one of the first online smartshops in Europe. Quite possibly in the entire universe. Today, we stock over 3000 products in the categories Smartshop, Headshop, Cannabis seeds, Vaporizers and Lifestyle.
Knowledge is everything.
It is important for us that you can safely and responsibly enjoy the gifts of Mother Nature. Therefore, we provide clear information for all products we sell in addition to an extensive encyclopedia on natural substances. We also provide links to trusted sources where you can find even more detailed information, user reports and advice.
Safety first.
We do not sell illegal substances or 'legal highs'. We do not sell to minors and we provide instructions for safe use with all of our products. We strongly advise every customer to follow these instructions. All our products are analysed; we know exactly where and how they are sourced. Our own herbs and herbal formulas are packed and produced in accordance with HACCP guidelines. Also, the majority of our products is organically grown and our providers aim to keep their environmental impact as low as possible.
