Why Incentives Alone Don’t Change Behavior
Forward-thinking organizations across the country are offering innovative commute benefits to shift employee commute behavior. Providing better commute options for employees means greater satisfaction, productivity, and retention. Achieving behavior change means reducing parking demand and parking costs, while improving the company’s bottom line. The intention is clear – it’s the approach that‘s misaligned. Recently, the focus has been on incentives. How do we offer the best and most creative incentives? How can we be certain that the chance to win a new bike or a few extra dollars in employees’ pockets will get them to adopt new commute modes?
