Here at Toby, we believe there's only one way to do a beloved Great British roast — and that's to do it properly. At Toby Carvery that’s exactly what you’ll find at all of our restaurants — great value Sunday roast dinners, every day of the week, made just the way they should be.
Every day, your local Toby Carvery restaurant lays on a family-sized feast of tender meats, eight lots of veg including crispy, ruffled roasties and all the trimmings. So you can enjoy your favourite carvery meal just the way you like it, whenever you like it at great value.
You'll find loads more on offer, such as tasty specials, all-you-can-eat breakfasts and even comfy accommodation at some of our restaurants. Children will find plenty to choose from on our family friendly roast dinner menus too.
Every spud is checked by hand and ruffled for extra crunch. All of our meat is slow-cooked and basted to succulent perfection. And our Yorkshires are freshly made in our kitchens then served crisp, fluffy and piping-hot to your plate. All of this is what makes us the home of the roast.
