Cell Biology
Developmental Biology
Mitochondrial fusion is required for spermatogonial differentiation and meiosis
Grigor Varuzhanyan et al.
Mitochondrial fusion enables a metabolic transition during spermatogenesis.
Neuroscience
Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine
Id4 promotes the elimination of the pro-activation factor Ascl1 to maintain quiescence of adult hippocampal stem cells
Isabelle Maria Blomfield et al.
Genetic and protein analyses in vitro and in vivo identifies Id4 as a novel regulator of stem cell quiescence in the adult hippocampus.
Biochemistry and Chemical Biology
Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics
Structural diversity of oligomeric Î²-propellers with different numbers of identical blades
Evgenia Afanasieva et al.
A protein fragment forms different folded structures when amplified to different copy numbers within a single polypeptide chain.
Ecology
Linking spatial patterns of terrestrial herbivore community structure to trophic interactions
Jakub Witold Bubnicki et al.
The spatial interactions between humans, large carnivores and herbivores cascade down in a complex but predictable way to lower trophic levels affecting regeneration of tree species in a temperate forest.
Developmental Biology
Evolutionary Biology
Extraocular, rod-like photoreceptors in a flatworm express xenopsin photopigment
Kate A Rawlinson et al.
A new opsin receptor is light-sensitive and expressed in a unique type of photoreceptor in a flatworm that encloses over 400 sensory cilia within its cell membrane.
Genetics and Genomics
Microbiology and Infectious Disease
Herpes simplex viral nucleoprotein creates a competitive transcriptional environment facilitating robust viral transcription and host shut off
Sarah E Dremel, Neal A DeLuca
Herpes simplex ICP4 preferentially binds to and delineates the viral genome, ultimately resulting in robust viral transcription at the expense of the host.
Computational and Systems Biology
Immunology and Inflammation
An evolutionary recent IFN-IL-6-CEBP axis is linked to monocyte expansion and tuberculosis severity in humans
Murilo Delgobo et al.
Neuroscience
Neural tracking of speech mental imagery during rhythmic inner counting
Lingxi Lu et al.
A disassociated neural network underlies the dynamic construction of speech mental imagery independent of auditory perception.
Developmental Biology
ZP4 confers structural properties to the zona pellucida essential for embryo development
Ismael Lamas-Toranzo et al.
Zona pellucida requires ZP4 protein to efficiently protect the developing embryo during in vivo pre-implantation development.
Ecology
Experimental investigation of ant traffic under crowded conditions
Laure-Anne Poissonnier et al.
Behavioral experiments reveal that ants, contrary to humans, avoid the formation of traffic jams at extreme density.
