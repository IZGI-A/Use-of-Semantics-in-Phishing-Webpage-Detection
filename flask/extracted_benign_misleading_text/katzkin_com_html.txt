Imagine your car with a luxurious, premium leather interior. Maybe you’ve wanted one but thought it was really expensive at the dealership. Or you didn’t know that you could easily upgrade your cloth seats on the car you have now. Whatever your dream, Katzkin can deliver it, adding luxury, comfort and style to your vehicle at an affordable price.
Katzkin is the nation’s premier manufacturer of custom leather seats. In partnership with our network of professional installers, we have transformed over two million vehicles. We offer more custom options than any other manufacturer with 3,000 interiors, available in 120 colors and materials, the choices are virtually limitless.
This is not a slip cover. Katzkin leather interiors completely transform the look and feel of your vehicle’s interior. Our network of professional installers remove the cloth from your front and rear seats, replacing it with your new Katzkin interior, including all the door panels and center console covering (depending on the vehicle). As a general rule: if it has cloth on it, we replace it.
We back it all up with our national 3-year/36,000–mile warranty and a guarantee that your leather seats will meet or exceed the fit and finish of a factory leather interior.
