About Us
Our founders, Ian and Alaric, were professional gamers who struggled to find a quality computer chair that ticked all the boxes:
- Incredibly comfortable even during long hours of usage
- Made of top-quality, industrial-grade materials
- Beautifully designed to fit in both a gaming or office setup
- Great prices without middlemen markup
They set out on a mission to solve the issue at hand, and the first Secretlab chair was rolled out in 2015 to critical acclaim.

Been looking into this chair for a while now. During the previous spring sale, I finally snatched it up. Never had a 'gaming chair' before. Super comfortable, not too soft, not too hard. Very sturdy and quite 'heavy' with a very premium feel to it. I have a super small 'nerd room' and I'm glad it fits in there :) Had to disassemble half of it to get it through the house though, but that was no sweat.
Definitely recommend this chair!
