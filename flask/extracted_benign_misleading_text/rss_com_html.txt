“Best podcast hosting service I have found and I’ve been looking a while”

Our Podcast Hosting Service allows podcasters like yourself to publish episodes by simply uploading them via their web browser as if they were webmail attachments.
We take care of all the rest by automatically generating and updating your RSS podcast feed and producing a dynamic website that includes a list of your most recent podcasts, a podcast archive, and a streaming media player.
Not only will your podcast’s RSS stream be available via the main podcast directories (e.g. Podcast Store by Apple), but it will be also reachable as a self-contained website, which will increase your podcast’s discoverability and visibility in search engines like Google.
