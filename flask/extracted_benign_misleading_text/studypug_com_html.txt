Year 11 maths student, Surrey, UK
I am a fast learner and able to grasp concepts pretty quickly. I use StudyPug to get ahead of my class and prepare for what my teacher will cover. I like it.
Parent of Year 9 student, London, UK
StudyPug covers all the topics me and my son have been looking for. We use the practice questions to make a fun little quiz at the end of each week. Something fun we can do together that helps him study.
