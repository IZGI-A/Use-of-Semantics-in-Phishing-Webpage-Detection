Everyone's Schedules in One Calendar
Use multiple calendars to share various schedules with your family, friends, social clubs and coworkers.
TimeTree was built with the goal of being an integral part of managing one’s schedules through sharing and communication. We wanted your living room calendar, work calendar and social calendar in the palm of your hand, with features that allowed you to share and communicate within the calendar itself.
Everyone's Schedules in One Calendar
Use multiple calendars to share various schedules with your family, friends, social clubs and coworkers.
The Schedule Screen is More Than a List
Each event you create has its own chat room. Comments and images can be sent. Ideas discussed. Plans locked in and memories recorded and preserved for you to enjoy in the future.
Save Plans Without Stressing Out
No more worrying about setting a date and time right then and there. The “Keep” tab lets you remove the stress and store an event to be worked out later on. Store To-do lists and simple notes next to the events that you are yet to figure out. Keep it all in this convenient to access, stress free section.
Keep Track
Who’s doing what? When plans are scheduled, edited, updated or liked, you can check up on what’s going on in your shared calendars here in this easy to use, handy tab.
