Our customers say
"Love Marley Spoon, we rely heavily on our meals as we both work full time and don't have time to think about what to cook. Love that there is lots of choice every week, and good healthy options."
Cathy, Sydney
"We've tried a few similar companies in the past and have been most impressed by Marley Spoon! Definitely the best of the lot!"
Katie, Fitzroy
"The recipes are well balanced, high quality and good portion sizes. I couldn't spend $70 in a supermarket and eat like this, and I work at a supermarket!"
