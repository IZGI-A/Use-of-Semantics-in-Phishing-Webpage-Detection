Join us on Facebook & Twitter to stay in touch, and sign up to our Team Parish e-newsletter (roughly monthly) for updates on services and events.
We are live streaming daily morning prayer throughout the week at 9.15am and a Sunday morning service at 10am on the Team Parish of St Luke in the City Liverpool Facebook page.
We're a small and friendly multi-racial congregation with members aged from 0 - 90 years old.
