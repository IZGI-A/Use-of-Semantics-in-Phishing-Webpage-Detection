Can anyone tell me when we will be able to get in and play Goodgames Empire? We have not been able to get in for almost two days. I really miss my alliance family. Plus I hope my food donâ€™t run out.
It says it undergoing maintenance. But for two days?
I just heard about a bot that auto-collects taxes. Has anyone tried it? http://cheatingnetwork.net/forums/public-bot-exploit-releases/81536-goodgames-empire-automatic-tax-collector.html
