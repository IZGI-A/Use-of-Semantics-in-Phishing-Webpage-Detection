[A Beloved’s Wrist] “You don’t give it a second thought most of the time…But in favoured circumstances – when it is framed by a leather watch strap, a crisp shirt cuff…you notice again the especially delicate skin on the inside of the forearm, the interplay of gentle curves, swelling, flaring, narrowing, turning back in…Just looking at this person’s wrist can renew certain tender feelings that, you realise, you’ve been losing sight of…The pleasure of looking at it is connected to remembering its history: how tiny it must have been when they were a baby, how it was once encased in woolen mittens…” - A heartwarming chapter from Small Pleasures by @theschooloflifelondon - Read more small pleasures on our latest blog, link in bio. . . . . . #Tordney #timepiece #wristshot #wristcandy #squarewatch #smallpleasures #watchesofinstagram #watchesofig #wristcheck #menswatches #womenswatch #ootdfashion #styleinspiration #fashionphotography #microbrandwatch

It strikes us that the circular pattern on the TRIO sub-dials look somewhat like the Japanese rock garden – karesansui. Don't they look like ripples in water? Have a mindful start of the day.

A Block of Time Limestones are created from centuries of compressed and crushed seashells. At the right bank of Bordeaux, limestone makes up most of the soil. With abundant calcium carbonate, grapevines bloom and blossom in the fields of St. Emilion, giving the harvests sufficient nutrients and a distinctive taste. The hardest limestone, named Asteries, has been used to build Chateaux in this winemaking small town dating back to the Roman-era. Our vintage-inspired dial gives off an elegant champagne colour – resonating with the beautiful limestone crafted by nature. #Tordney #TordneyJourney #microbrandwatch #Bordeaux #StEmilion #SaintEmilion #France #Francja #oldtown #history #limestone #chateau #architecture #wine #champagne #vineyard #bordeauxblend #winecountry #winetour #finewine #harvest #grapes #watches #timepiece #montres #tenuedujour #outfitdujour #vintagechic #vintageinspired
