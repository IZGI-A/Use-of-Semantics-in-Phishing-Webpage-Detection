I am proud to represent the
National Association of Hispanic Federal Executives (NAHFE) in
helping to take concrete steps to assist Federal agencies in
recruiting and hiring qualified Hispanics to meet the unique
challenges of the 21st Century. I am inspired by the
dedication and professionalism of NAHFE members who help meet
the goals of the organization and position NAHFE to help
Hispanics advance in their career within Federal Government,
and to prepare them for the challenges ahead.
