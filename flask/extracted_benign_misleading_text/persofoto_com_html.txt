I am happy with persofoto..

So easy and quick to use! Takes the hassle out of passport or driving license photos. Can't believe how quickly my photos arrived (3 days)!! Haven't sent off my licence application yet but I'm quite sure the photo will be accepted, it looks exactly like the professional ones you normally take in the photo booths.

For 2 times persofoto was a huge help for me, and for my surprise, when I arrive to the final stage of the proto generating I see that's free to download. I'm really impressed and pleased with persofoto. Thank you very much for saving me a lot of time.

I was worried the photos would take forever to arrive with the company based so far away; however I received them in 5 days with the free delivery option. Excellent photos, simple process and the order tracker is handy too. Great job, well done!

Really good quality photos. The last time I had photos made for my passport, Identification papers and health card, I did it in a photography shop here in town. They charged me about 3 times more than persofoto and the photos were really not of a very good quality. And that was about 9 years ago. This time I took the photos myself and let Persofoto do the rest. Very happy with the result
