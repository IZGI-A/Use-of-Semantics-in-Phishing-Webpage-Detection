Quiet,
Except for the Wind:
poems and stories from the cold desert
Finalist for the 2017 Willa Award from Women Writing the West
Here is a glimpse at a world most people will never know: a world of wild things and not-so-wild, four-legged and two, that move through the seasons that anchor our work on the ranch, the characters that flow through our histories and the inexorable processes that shape this world: flood, fire, drought.
2017 Willa Judge: " Carolyn Dufurrena captures the desert's dichotomy between extremes, where miracles happen. The desert yields its secrets of beauty to those who are quiet enough to observe."
"Reviewers say: "Brave", "Magnificent"
"After the third read, it still moved me to tears."
