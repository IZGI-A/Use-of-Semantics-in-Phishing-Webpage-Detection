Why Hello There...
I am Rachel, the owner of Raelynn Photography. The first thing you should know about me... photography is the job I love most, to me, it's not even work.
This love affair all started when I was seven years-old, sneaking off with my big sister's camera. Since that time, I have been obsessed with photography.
When I have camera in hand, I am always wearing the biggest smile! It fills me joy and privilege to work with clients, and be apart of capturing special moments.
So give me a call!
