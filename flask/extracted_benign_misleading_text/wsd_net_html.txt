Weber High School Student takes 1st at FBLA National Leadership Conference
Weber High Schoolâ€™s Koby Pack takes 1st place at FBLA National Leadership Conference
Competing in San Antonio, Texas among 12,000 students in over 70 categories, Koby Pack, a Weber High student brought home 1st Place and the title of National Champion in the Sales Presentation Category.
Congratulations to Koby Pack led by Mr. Alan Rawlins, business/marketing instructor and FBLA advisor.
Although 105 individuals competed at the national leadership conference in the Sales Presentation event, it is not easy to get there or to get into finals. Only two percent of FBLA students advance to the national level, so just getting there to compete is a great achievement. For students to make finals at Nationals they must be in the top 2 of their preliminary section out of 13-14 students.
