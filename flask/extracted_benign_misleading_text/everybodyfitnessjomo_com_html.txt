We are EXCITED to be Joplinâ€™s newest fitness facility, offering exclusive group fitness classes for all levels and ages. All classes are pay-as-you-go, meaning that there are NO MEMBERSHIPS or contracts
We believe that every BODY is beautiful.
We stand behind the fact that fitness is for any age, at any stage, and that health is for all sizes.
We understand that not all persons are created the same and overall wellness is more important than body perfection.

Every BODY Fitness is a BYOM facility (bring your own mat). This helps to cut down on any possible transfer of germs between mats, and saves on cleaning materials. We provide all equipment used in classes, and have water (and coffee) for sale in the lobby. Yoga mats can also be purchased for $15, should you need one. :-)
Every BODY Fitness is a pay-as-you-go facility. NO memberships or pre-registration is required.
We take your safety seriously, and are taking as many precautions as possible to assure this. In addition to social distancing, a new HVAC and ventilation system was installed this past August 2020. We are taking time to disinfect all equipment and sitting areas, regularly and you will find hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes in every room in the building. Additionally, Every BODY Fitness is a BYOM (Bring Your Own Mat) facility, so this assists in cutting down any possible exchange of sweat.
