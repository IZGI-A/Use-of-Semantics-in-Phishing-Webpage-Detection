It took us almost a year of work to get RedMoon's business, platform and tools off the ground.
With the general moonID update, our new hosting infrastructure, the build pipeline, automated testing, we are at the technical forefront again. That was the necessary foundation on which everything else is now built. Some construction sites, such as a further update of the payments, will follow as the platform expands.
Once again, we bring the existing games to the new technology. Now, for the first time, we can update the game worlds centrally and quickly. Improve a bug and roll out an update immediately, effort four minutes and no longer four weeks. You understand what this means for all of us in daily gaming.
In order to do all this in the support, we have Patti at our side next to Tommelchen and so that there is something for the eye next to technology and support, our legendary creative and creator of the MonstersGame and KnightFight Designs Raffaele Picca will join us again. Welcome everyone!
In this sense, we are approaching the fuller moon for a long time. We are looking forward to the next round with you and would like to thank you for your loyalty with the current Halloween Premium Promotion and Uncle Pumpkin.
