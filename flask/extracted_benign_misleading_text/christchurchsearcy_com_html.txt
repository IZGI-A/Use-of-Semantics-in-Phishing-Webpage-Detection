Welcome To Christ Church in Searcy
Christ Church is a community of Christians in Searcy, Arkansas, called to Christ and to one another through the power of the gospel. Our church family includes Christians of a variety of ages and backgrounds drawn together for worship and mission. We seek to honor God through biblical liturgy and to embody the gospel of God's grace in our fellowship, Searcy, White County and throughout the world. Our "What to Expect" page introduces what it means for us to be a reformed church and to engage in liturgical worship. Join us at 10:30 each Sunday.
Todd Davis,
Christ Church Minister
