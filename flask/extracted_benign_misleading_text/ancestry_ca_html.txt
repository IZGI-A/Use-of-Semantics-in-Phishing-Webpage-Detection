So I traded in my lederhosen for a kilt.”
Growing up, Kyle’s family was German, no doubt about it. He even grew up wearing lederhosen in a German dance troupe. But when Kyle began building his family tree, he couldn’t actually find any German ancestors.
“So I decided to have my DNA tested, and the big surprise was we're not German at all,” he says. And soon enough, Ancestry Hints led him to generations of Scottish ancestors.

It just made me feel like I belong somewhere.”
When Idries created his family tree, he started with just the name of his parents and grandparents. Soon, Ancestry Hints started popping up: "I was getting all these leaves, taking me back generation after generation."
Joining forces with his twin, Jamil, the brothers uncovered fascinating stories about their ancestors. They both agree, "You feel like you know these people—you feel connected to them."
I thought I had married an Italian?”
Marrying into Eric's family, Katherine was told of a rich Italian family history—"My lineage was all Vecchios and the Zuccolis," according to Eric. But when Eric's AncestryDNA results said he was only 16%, Katherine took on the search and discovered an Eastern European ancestor he never knew he had.
Katherine and Eric used both AncestryDNA and a family tree to solve their mystery—how will you begin your journey?
