About HindiMatrimony
HindiMatrimony is an online matrimony service, pioneered by BharatMatrimony. Weddings of Hindi-speaking brides
and grooms
are known to be rich in tradition and culture.
Some of the important wedding rituals are Kanyadaan, Panigrahana, and Saptapadi. Kanyadaan is the ceremony where the father of the bride gives her away to the groom. During Panigrahana the groom takes the bride's hand as a sign of union for life. Saptapadi is the most important ritual, where the couple takes seven steps near the fire and each step corresponds to a vow the bride makes to the groom.
