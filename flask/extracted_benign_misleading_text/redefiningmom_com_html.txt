Where women thrive in motherhood and business.
you don't have to choose one over the other!
HI! I'm Monica,
entrepreneur... mother... rebel.
I don't believe that women have to choose between their careers and family. You can have anything you set your mind to.
First and foremost, I am a mom to two beautiful girls. After 11 years in Corporate America, working in Channel Marketing for a Fortune 100 company, I quit my corporate job for a flexible lifestyle and never looked back.
I provide online marketing education to small businesses that are looking to build a profitable revenue stream through effective sales funnels and Pinterest ads. Learn how I can help you!
