MJUC and MJUC jr. released
Tuesday, July 14, 2015
After almost two years of R&D the new Klanghelm compressor has been release. As with previous Klanghelm releases, there's a free little brother too. The new compressor consists of three very different variable-mu compressor models, offering a wide range of tube compression implementations and also a modern new approach on this topology. MJUC is the first Klanghelm plugin, that's been coded with a new framework. It imparts a lot of new usability features, such as GUI-resizing, finally a decent preset browser with save/copy/paste/save-as-default functionality, A-B-ing, customizable knob-behavior and more. These features will find their way to the existing Klanghelm plugins later this year.
