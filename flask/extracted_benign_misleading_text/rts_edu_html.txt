What's my financial investment?
With the rise of student loan debt, we know that cost is one of your top concerns. Rather than cutting corners to lower tuition, we’ve partnered with churches and believers around the world to offer stellar education that is affordable.
Why? We believe that no one should have to go deep into debt in order to study God’s word.
