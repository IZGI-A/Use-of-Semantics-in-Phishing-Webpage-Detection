Toschi Nocello Liqueur
Distiller Score 88
Golden in color, Toschi Nocello has the heady aroma you'd expect from a liqueur flavored with walnuts and hazelnuts. Its oily texture gives way to a slightly bitter walnut flavor that would lend itself well to cocktails. It's perhaps a bit overbalanced with vanilla sweetness.

Glenfiddich Grand Cru 23 Year
Distiller Score 92
This is a lusciously rich dram from Glenfiddich, landing sweetly on the palate with notes of toffee, pear, and almond. A bit of salt and a gently floral finish linger after sipping. It would make an excellent night cap or pair nicely with a cheese course.
