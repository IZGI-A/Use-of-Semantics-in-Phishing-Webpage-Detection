Hello and Namasthe :)
I am Manasa A
Hi, I am Manasa A based from Bangalore. Professionally I am a UI/UX Designer but at home I am all time aspired cook.
"Aspire to inspire before you expire" is my main motto in my life. I am passionate recipe developer, food blogger and a proud home chef. My main intention is to keep my family's tummy very happy. I also want to share my recipes to the beginners, spinsters/bachelors and people who are passionate towards cooking.
