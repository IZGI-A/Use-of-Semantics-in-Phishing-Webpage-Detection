Public Comment Sought on Amendment to School Calendar PolicyAt the October 8 meeting, the Board of Education chose to publish three calendar options for public comment including an option which allows for the opening of MCPS schools and offices on Inauguration Day. Currently Board Policy IDA states, "When the day of a Presidential Inauguration falls on a school day, that day shall be designated as a MCPS system holiday." Therefore, the Board took Tentative Action on draft Board Policy IDA, School Year Calendar, which includes an amendment to allow for schools and offices to be open on Inauguration Day.
