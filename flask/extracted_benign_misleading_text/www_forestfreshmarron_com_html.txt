What are marron
Marron (Cherax cainii) are a freshwater crayfish endemic to the South West of Western Australia. The pristine waters of the South West offer an optimum growing environment for these crustaceans as they are extremely sensitive to water quality. Though marron occur naturally in streams and rivers, the numbers are low due to poaching and over fishing.
All Marron sold through Forest Fresh Marron is farmed sustainably in either ponds or dams which mimic the natural environment. This type of farming has an extremely low impact on the environment and provides a chemical and antibiotic “free range” for the marron to develop.
Marron are the best tasting freshwater crustacean in the world according to several world class chefs and have more meat to shell ratio than other crustaceans. They vary in colour from black to magnificent cobalt blue due to genetic variation and when cooked become a mouthwatering orange. Marron can be cooked in many ways, the easiest and quickest is by boiling. For a delicious and attractive alternative they can be butterflied and barbecued!
