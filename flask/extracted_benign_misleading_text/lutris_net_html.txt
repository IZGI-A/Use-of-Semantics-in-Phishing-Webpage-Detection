Lutris is an Open Source gaming platform for Linux. It installs and launches games so you can start playing without the hassle of setting up your games. Get your games from GOG, Steam, Battle.net, Origin, Uplay and many other sources running on any Linux powered gaming machine.
Lutris uses community contributed installation scripts to provide an
optimal experience and setup. Once installed, games are launched with
programs called runners. Those runners include RetroArch, Dosbox,
customized Wine versions and many more!
