Butternut squash pasta…all you need is roasted butternut squash, juicy sweet sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and wait, that’s it! Just add pasta and a little cheese and you’re done in 25 minutes!
There’s not a lot of time for dinner, and you’re tired of the same 5 meals. I’m feeling the exact same but lately this 25 Minute Butternut Squash Pasta has been saving the day!
We like to try and do at least one vegetarian meal every week. I wish we did it more, but what can I say? We love meat in our house! This dish is delish though, everyone loves it and you don’t even miss the protein!
