TrackYourHours knows the rules. Do you?
What are the new experience requirements & how will they impact me?
-
What changes were made to the LPCC requirements January 1, 2016?
The category maximum (250) for workshops, training and conferences is eliminated
The category maximum (500) for group therapy is eliminated
The category maximum (250) for telehealth counseling is eliminated
The category maximum (250) for administering and evaluating psych tests, writing clinical reports, progress or process notes is eliminated
-
How will these changes impact me? Does it matter when I submit my application?
Although the BBS is phasing in the new requirements (allowing applicants to choose the old requirements if they submit on or before December 31, 2020), in all instances applicants will want to choose to be evaluated under the NEW requirements. Because the new requirements eliminate some of the individual category maximums there is no instance where choosing the old requirements would be beneficial. You will want to be evaluated under the new requirements.
Will my claimable hours increase under the new requirements? It depends…Your claimable hours will only increase under the new requirements if you have previously maxed out one or more of the sub-categories that no longer have a maximum (workshops, group therapy, telehealth, administering and evaluating psych tests, etc.). In addition, for the categories of workshops and evaluating psych tests, etc. you will only gain hours if you have not yet maxed out the Non-counseling Experience Category.
TrackYourHours allows you to quickly and easily see exactly how many hours you can claim under both the old and new requirements.

What changes were made to the MFT requirements January 1, 2016?
The category of non-counseling experience is now called non-clinical practice, the category maximum is increased from 1,000 to 1,250 and the sub-categories of administering and evaluating psychological tests, writing clinical reports, writing progress or process notes and client-centered advocacy are added to the category.
The category maximum (500) for administering and evaluating psych tests, writing clinical reports, progress or process notes and client-centered advocacy is eliminated.
The category maximum (500) for group therapy is eliminated.
The category maximum (375) for telehealth is eliminated.
Personal psychotherapy hours can no longer be claimed.
Conjoint couples/family hours can no longer be double counted.
Under the old requirements applicants must log a minimum of 1,500 hours of direct counseling with individuals, groups, couples or families. Under the new requirements this increases to 1,750 hours.

How will these changes impact me? Does it matter when I submit my application?
If you submit your application on or before December 31, 2020 you can choose to be evaluated under either the old or new requirements. Applications submitted from January 1, 2021 forward will be evaluated under the new requirements.
The changes in the experience requirements may result in a significant change in the hours that you can claim. The elimination of the double counting of couples/family hours and personal psychotherapy hours may reduce the hours that can be claimed under the new requirements. The elimination of the individual category maximums may result in an increase in your valid total under the new requirements.
The TrackYourHours software allows you to view an analysis of your hours under both the old and new requirements so you can quickly and easily decide which option is best for you.
-

You can now claim workshops, seminars, training sessions or conferences.
The weekly maximum for supervision hours has increased from 5 to 6.
TrackYourHours allows you to quickly and easily see how many hours you can claim under both the old and new requirements.

Will my claimable hours be higher under the new requirements? It depends…If you have already maxed out the category of Client Centered Advocacy, Consultation, Evaluation, and Research, the ability to claim supervision and workshop hours will NOT increase your claimable hours because the category maximum remains at 1,200 and supervision and workshop hours are now counted toward the combined category max.
