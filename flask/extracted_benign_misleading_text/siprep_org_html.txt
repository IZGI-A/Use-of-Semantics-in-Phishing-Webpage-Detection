Welcome to St. Ignatius College Preparatory
St. Ignatius College Preparatory is more than merely a high school. It is a community of lifelong learners that supports students as they develop into thriving adults. With a commitment to intellectual excellence, leadership, service, and justice, our students strive to respond courageously to the opportunities and challenges of our time. Through a rigorous and integrated program of academic, spiritual, and co-curricular activities, St. Ignatius educates all aspects of our students according to the Jesuit philosophy of Cura Personalis, care for the whole person.
