It's personal
Given the choice, we'd all love to shop local more often... it's just that sometimes the other stores (you know the ones) are more convenient. Sure, we can get some of what we need there; it's just not nearly as fulfilling. With Mercato, you don't have to compromise. You get the highest quality ingredients and curated, unique items all while supporting the best merchants in your community.
Our founder, Bobby, started Mercato to help his father grow his Brooklyn butcher shop. Today, the platform helps hundreds of other independent grocers do what they love and have confidence and ability to thrive in today's rapidly changing retail landscape.
