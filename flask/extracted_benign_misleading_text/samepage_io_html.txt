PAGES. THE ULTIMATE
COLLABORATIVE CANVAS.
Pages are our most powerful tool. Remote teams often use them to run meetings, manage projects, coordinate events, co-author documents, host brainstorming sessions, display reporting dashboards - pretty much anything you can think of.
Your team can edit them together, from any device. While one coworker is adding and assigning tasks on a page, another could be adding text, images, videos, maps, spreadsheets, and so much more. Each coworker sees what the other is doing on screen in real time.
Add comments to a page's chat section or on a specific piece of content. Combined with the ability to track changes and access version control, pages provide the ultimate historical context on projects, plans, meetings, & more.
Try Samepage Pro, free for 30 days. Then continue with Samepage Free for as long as you like.
TEAM TEXT & VIDEO CHAT
Free chat tools built to boost team productivity
Connecting via group text or video call is always one click away. It cuts time spent sending emails, making phone calls, and organizing video conferences in half.
Our game-changer comes from a unique feature called "content chat". Anything you share on a page can have a conversation attached, and it'll blend in with the page chat history too. In other words, it's threaded conversation done right.
Plus, unlimited use of our entire communication tool set is completely free. Does Slack offer that? Nope.
PROJECT COLLABORATION
Tasks & calendars keep projects moving forward
Most times, you'll want to see tasks alongside other project content, like files, diagrams, and conversations. Other times, you'll just want to see a task list or a calendar of due dates. No matter what your preferred style of task management is, you'll find it here.
Tasks can be as functional as you need them to be. Keep it simple, or assign them to coworkers with due dates, priority level, reminders, recurrence, sub-tasks, and description details.
FILE SHARING & SYNCING
Helping you keep team files updated, accessible, & safe
Drag & drop files on a page and edit them in place to share changes with the team automatically. No emailing a file around for approval or wondering if your inbox has the latest version.
Already sharing files on Dropbox or another file-sharing service? No problem. You can still collaborate on them in Samepage.
Still prefer editing files from your desktop? We hear you. Turn on our team file synchronization option so changes you make are shared online with the rest of the team instantly, and vice versa.

#SamepageReviews
"I'm at the airport heading home, having a couple beers. Had a great week in AZ. Everyone is loving Samepage!! I honestly can't imagine going back to the old way. My exec meetings with multiple locations worked flawlessly. Just thought I'd share the good vibes."
Mariah Gray
"It just works! Tried 30 plus different systems - it is the perfect balance of simplicity and power. The philosophy is profoundly elegant and intuitive."
Bryan Gibson
"We have a team across 6 locations in 4 countries and this is our only collaboration tool. It has replaced email and kills any of the other project management tools. We had used 6 other online tools before this one and they were all so clunky. Setting up a project in other tools is not intuitive, whereas Samepage takes less than a minute."
Steve Cranitch
"Anyway, Samepage is nice. Cool interface. Works very well. If you could make my irritating client a little less irritating though, that would be just super."
Anonymous
"I tried many collaboration apps for my team (i.e. Slack, HipChat, Ryver, Spaces, etc.) and none can come close to what Samepage can do. Samepage has amazing features, integration, user-friendliness, speedy support."
Ron Gomez
"First -- the customer service. One-on-one personalized support with a dedicated support person. Karla was amazing -- personable and very knowledgeable."
Josseline Charas
"Ultimately if you need a central 'hub' where you can share and communicate without jumping through hoops - Samepage is everything you need wrapped up in a very powerful package that makes my work life that much easier."

"Samepage provides a very cohesive platform, and has promoted collaboration, transparency and a sense of team. Inviting customers as guests to participate is a real plus. It integrates seamlessly with all our cloud storage solutions and is super easy to use."
John Schubach
"I just decided to switch off one of the more popular platforms. So far my experience with Samepage has been great. Great customer service and I find it much easier to concentrate on each project since everything is literally on the SAME PAGE as your work."
Tony Blauer
"From the beginning to the end Samepage has won me over. It has made organizing projects and workflows manageable and real-time internal and external collaboration simple."

"There's so much to be said about collaboration tools and the differences among them, but my absolute favorite thing about Samepage is how intuitive and familiar it feels right from the start."
Kyle McGowan

"We have long needed the functionality of a product like Samepage and since implementing it in both our head office and geographically distant companies, we have increased our efficiency and significantly reduced the amount of time spent emailing, calling, and sending files."
Tam Jansen
