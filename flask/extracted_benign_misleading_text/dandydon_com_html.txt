Good morning, Tiger Fans,
Excitement is quickly building for this weekend’s 2:30 p.m. CT SEC West showdown between No. 2 LSU and No. 9 Auburn. And it’s not just because this is a top-10 matchup of SEC West Powerhouses. No, as Tiger fans, you don’t need me to remind you that LSU vs. Auburn is always a big deal. Fueled by chop blocks and cigars, earthquakes and burning barns, a rumble with the marching band, and countless competitive contests, this is one of the most storied and thrilling rivalries in all of college football.

Two of the most thrilling contests between the two teams came in the previous two seasons.
In 2017, LSU overcame a 20-point deficit to pull off the program’s greatest SEC comeback since 1977 and its largest ever come-from-behind SEC win in Tiger Stadium. That game will forever be remembered as “The Comeback Game” or “The Rally in the Valley.”
Then last year, LSU rallied back from a 21-10 third-quarter deficit in a game that featured two key do-or-die pass conversions, including a nine-yard fourth-down completion to Stephen Sullivan, as well as one of the most memorable LSU field goals in program history. With two seconds on the clock, Cole Tracy’s 42-yard field goal lifted LSU to victory and sent a statement to the world that these Tigers were for real. I’ll forever think of that one as the “Ice Cole Tracy Game.”

And here’s a comprehensive listing of some of the most notable LSU-Auburn games since 1988, as provided by LSU’s Sports Information Department.
In today’s report, we’ll begin breaking down the big contest by looking at our weekly stat comparison of LSU and its opponent. But first, a little background on where the two teams are coming from. LSU enters the game riding an 8-game winning streak and is 7-0 overall and 3-0 in league play. Auburn is the third Top-10 opponent the Tigers will have faced this season. As for those other Tigers, Auburn is coming off a 51-10 win over Arkansas and brings a 6-1 overall mark and a 3-1 league record into the game. Their one loss came against Florida two weeks ago. Okay, now that that’s out of the way, let’s look at the numbers.

One thing that jumped out to me when compiling LSU’s stats is the average rushing yards per contest. Three games into the season, the Tigers were averaging 115 rushing yards per contest. Heck, entering the Utah State contest the Tigers were averaging just 130 yards on the ground per contest. Ed Orgeron and his staff have made it a point to strengthen the rushing game and we’ve seen a steady improvement in that area with the Tigers now up to 154 yards per game. But make no mistake about it, passing yards are what fuel LSU’s offense, with 71% of the Tigers’ yardage coming through the air.
Auburn’s offense is built on its run game. They run the ball 65% of the time and lead the league with an average of 240 rushing yards per contest. To beat them, you must slow down their rushing attack. Florida had success doing this and limited Auburn to just 124 rushing yards in a 24-13 win for the Gators.
One thing you must take into account when considering Auburn’s rushing numbers is that their leading rusher, JaTarvious Whitlow, suffered a left knee injury late in the Florida game and had surgery shortly after. Still, even without Whitlow last week, Auburn rushed for 298 yards in their win over Arkansas. The strength of Auburn’s run game is not necessarily who’s carrying the ball, but its offensive line.
On the flip side, LSU and Auburn are two of the best teams in the SEC when it comes to stopping the run. Auburn does it with its stout defensive line, led by Derrick Brown, while LSU likes to play defensive backs, such as Grant Delpit and JaCoby Stevens, near the line of scrimmage to aid in run support.
What’s interesting is LSU and Auburn are giving up the same amount of yards per contest this season, although the perception around the league (or even among LSU’s fanbase) seems to be that Auburn is one of the best defenses in the conference and LSU is a middle of the pack. The truth is each have top four defenses in the SEC in terms of yards allowed. (Alabama is sixth for those of you that are interested).
LSU remains perfect in red zone scoring (even though one of Cade York’s field goal just barely cleared the bar off a ricochet). But the Tigers had a significant drop in touchdown percentage in the red zone after settling for three field goals against Mississippi State. Still, the Tigers lead the conference in touchdown percentage.
LSU leads the conference in yards per kickoff returns, while Auburn has struggled to make a mark in that phase. Both LSU and Auburn are two of the better field goal kicking teams, with each holding an 80 percent conversion rate or better.
Closing Tidbits:
• In recruiting news, five-star tight end Arik Gilbert is set to announce his school of choice today. Gilbert visited LSU for the Florida game but is believed by most to be leaning toward Alabama. I have not heard anything to suggest that he’ll chose the Tigers today, but you never know.
• It appears that LSU freshman guard Kardell Thomas is recovering much faster than originally projected. Thomas injured his ankle and underwent surgery during preseason camp and at that time he was expected to miss the entire season. But just this week, Thomas participated in LSU’s light practice on Monday without pads and in yesterday’s practice with pads. What this means for his potential return this year is unclear, but it’s certainly a good sign.
• In other practice news, reports indicate that backup left tackle Dare Rosenthal was absent during the media viewing period for the second straight day.
• Here’s an annual article that readers always find interesting: USAToday’s NCAA Head Coaches Salaries Database. As tweeted by reporter Steve Berkowitz, the SEC is now the only conference to ever have all of its coaches making at least $3 million. The average total pay for an SEC coach is $4.95 million. I’d say LSU is getting quite a bargain in Coach Ed Orgeron at “only” at $4 million.
