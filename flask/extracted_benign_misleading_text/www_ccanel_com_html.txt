CV
My research broadly covers high performance software systems, from network function policy upgrades to protocols for hybrid packet/circuit networks and efficient ML inference on resource-constrained devices.
I was advised by Professor Dave Andersen and Michael Kaminsky for three years. In the NetSys Lab, I worked on big data analytics systems with Kay Ousterhout and Professors Sylvia Ratnasamy and Scott Shenker. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2015.
I am from San Diego, CA.
