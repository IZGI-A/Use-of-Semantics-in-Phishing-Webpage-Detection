Solving a need that I had!
Lance Rubin
CEO & Founder of Model Citizn and professional financial modeler and trainer for FMI
Â« Eloquens is solving a need that I had in terms of hosting my Excel models, which I didn't really want to host locally on my website, but rather link to another platform.

Alexander Jarvis
Founder at Perfect Pitch Deck
Â« Eloquens is a great idea to solve the problem so many people have with finding the tools they want! 75% of all startup is the same, so why Reinvent the Wheel when someone has done it already?

Giving Back To The Entrepreneurial Community
Brian Weisberg
Head of Finance and Business Operations at Tidelift, Inc.
Â« My interest in Eloquens stems from my passion for open source and free software - that is free as in speech, not free as in beer. I am a firm believer in paying it forward. I have often found myself looking to answer a number of particular (and often common) financial questions. Knowing that I am not the only one looking for answers, I'd like to give back to the broader entrepreneurial community, both to people who may not have the necessary resources or background to build a tool or to those who do, but spare time is scarce (who likes reinventing the wheel anyway?). Â»
Distributive. Binding. Competitive.
Henry Sheykin
#1 SAAS TOOL in 2018 Financial Model creator
Â« Distributive. Binding. Competitive. All about Eloquens.com through my prism. My first and foremost objective on Eloquens is to share the knowledge I have. And the most exciting thing about it is that this sharing process is mutual. So, pragmatically, Eloquens is not just a platform to share yourself but also to absorb yourself. I benefit from Eloquens as an additional high-end channel to draw attention to the financial models I create. My portfolio here works as a proof of my competence and a hook for the potential customers. Certainly, it serves to the advantage of the business-makers of any scope or level. On this behalf, I strongly recommend others to enjoy the service to the full. Â»

Generating Passive Revenue!
Asen Gyczew
Expert in performance improvement and restructuring with significant experience
Â« I am using Eloquens as a part of our content marketing strategy. While for disseminating presentations we use Slideshare, Eloquens is much better suited for business analysis and financial models.

100% recommend Eloquens
David Hubbard
Freelancing producing Finance Models for both "bricks & mortar" startups and SAAS startups.
Â« I use Eloquens because it is easily the best web portal for promoting the skills that I have built up over the years. It connects me quickly and easily to the essential worldwide market segment I need with the very minimum of hassle. You create a product, or take it off the shelf if already done, upload it and let Eloquens do all the hard work. It has connected me with more customers and potential customers in the two months that I have been using than I found from over a year of using other Freelance sites - whose names I had better not mention! I would 100% recommend Eloquens to other professionals in my position - from both an ease of use perspective and also, not insignificantly, its excellent pricing model. Â»
The GitHub in the world of finance
Alex Martyanov

Gaurav Sandhya
Co-Founder of Tight The Nut
Â« Eloquens provides a one stop solution for my start-up. When starting my own start-up, I was not aware about how to build financial projections in the context of a fundraising round.
