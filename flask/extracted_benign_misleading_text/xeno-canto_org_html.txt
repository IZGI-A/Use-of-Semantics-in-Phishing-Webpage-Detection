In 1990 the Australian ornithologist Ron Johnstone observed a Myzomela on the island of Rote in the Lesser Sundas in Indonesia. In 2009 the birds were observed again by Belgian birders Philippe Verbelen and Veerle Dossche who noticed that the songs they recorded were quite different from other Myzomela populations. The taxon has been described as Rote Myzomela Myzomela irianawidodoae. In the same year Philippe came across Myzomelas on Alor, that also turned out to have quite different vocalisations. These have now been described as Alor Myzomela Myzomela prawiradilagae. For now the recordings are stored on XC under Myzomela kuehni.

Lots of recordings coming in these days. Gabriel Jamie is adding a really nice set from north-western Zambia. Always nice to see some blanks in Africa being filled in. & Richard Webster has been busy for weeks now uploading a meticulously annotated set, representing many sound types per species, as is his custom, from Mexico. Thanks for sharing everyone!!
Marc Anderson, Barry Edmonston and Ken Behrens have added quite a few recordings from Papua in the last few weeks. The region is stacked with poorly known and spectacular sounding birds. Thanks for sharing!
Peter Ericsson and Phil Gregory recently have also contributed with a great set of recordings of several rare species from this unique island..

Some great recordings from Congo Brazzaville by Matthias D'haen. The Congo still is a poorly represented area in XC. Thanks for sharing Matthias!!
On his recordist page Mathias is writing that he's still looking for a platform to share his mammal recordings. Maybe XC should grab this chanceâ€¦ I guess mammal recordings from Central Africa are hard to come by. And probably very cool to listen to...
We are taking small steps toward this aim. Grasshoppers and Crickets first. We'll keep you posted. In the mean time uploads as soundscape with the mammals or insects mentioned as background are a workaround.
