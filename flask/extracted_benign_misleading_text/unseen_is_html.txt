Greetings Unseen community member
Unseen Communicator for secure P2P communications is now ready for early testing. You should only use this for testing, there are still improvements being made.
Unseen Chat has been experiencing DDOS attacks from China. We are working hard to restore service. Also, the forthcoming Unseen Distributed +P2P Chat is almost ready for testing. We expect an announcement in the next several days.
We're sorry that email service is down for some users. Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience caused. Unseen's Admin Team is working to restore the service, we request you to contact adminreport@unseen.is to resolve your issue.
Thank you for your support of Unseen.
