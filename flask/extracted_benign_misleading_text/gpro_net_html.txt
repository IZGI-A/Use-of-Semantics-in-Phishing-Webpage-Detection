Feature overview
Tune in every Tuesday and Friday at 20:00 CET to watch the race events unfold LIVE! Will your strategy earn you a deserved victory, or a visit to the tyre wall? Find out and chat along live with your rivals...
Search the driver markets for the next Senna or Schumacher, who might jump into the cockpit and deliver instant results - or perhaps train a youngster to climb the ranks to become eventual World Champion!
Improve your car, train your driver and staff, sign tyre contracts, and purchase new facilities - but manage all this within the constraints of your limited budget to avoid going into debt and ruining your season...
Analyse your race results, fuel consumption, and tyre wear - enabling you to plan and calculate better race and pit stop strategies, which will hopefully transform that podium place into a win!
Choose to race with one of over 100 standard or supporter liveries - or perhaps even show off your artistic flair by designing your very own personal livery that only you can race with!
Successfully promote to Amateur class, and you can launch your own team! Sign up fellow managers to join your outfit, design your own team livery, and work together to win the team championship or cup!
