Jak dobrać odpowiedni rozmiar?
Aby wybrać odpowiedni rozmiar, zmierz swoją klatkę piersiową jak pokazano na obrazku.
Przyłoż miarkę do klatki piersiowej bezpośrednio pod pachami i zmierz jej obwód.
Upewnij się, że miarka przylega płasko do ciała.
Miej na uwadze, że rozmiar bluzy może się różnić do 3cm zarówno pod względem długości jak i szerokości.
