Let’s be honest. Most products we buy today are designed to last through a single fashion cycle. If we’re lucky, that's a year, maybe two. As a society we’ve become conditioned to expect very little from our clothing. When it fails, we throw it out, and buy another one. When GRIP6 was founded, we had one goal- make the best belt that’s ever been made. We define success a little differently than most companies. We want our belts to look good, function better, and last longer, than any belt you’ve ever worn before. Though we’re getting close, we are still working to improve every aspect of our design, and that process will never stop.
We manufacture all of our products right here in Salt Lake City, out of materials that are 100% sourced from the USA. Our hands-on manufacturing approach allows us immediate control over the manufacturing process. We are constantly evaluating our procedures and our product to find ways where we can improve.
The end result is a web belt that we proudly stand behind. A belt that we all wear, every single day. When you purchase a GRIP6 belt, you are buying into a company that is committed to producing a product that exceeds your expectations. We want to thank our customers, both old and new, for your support and your feedback. Let us know if there is anything we can be doing better. In the meantime, we’ll keep working to make the best belts on earth.
We accept all major payment methods (Visa, Amex, Mastercard, Discover, PayPal, Google Pay) and back our products with a lifetime guarantee. You can return your belt for a replacement or full refund to the payment method you used at any time, in any condition, for any reason. Just pay return shipping. Simply call or email us and we would be more than happy to help you out.
