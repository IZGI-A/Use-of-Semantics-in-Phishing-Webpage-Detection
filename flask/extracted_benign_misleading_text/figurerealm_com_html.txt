King Kong Bundy Character Profile - Updated by bbblackwell
Tuesday, October 22, 2019
Bundy began his career in 1981 with the WWF, but quickly relocated to Texas to wrestle for the Von Erich family in World Class Championship Wrestling. Here, he took on the moniker “King Kong”, and had the notable honor of wrestling the legendary Fritz Von Erich in his 1982 retirement match.
Making a name for himself throughout the country, Bundy competed in the AWA, the NWA, Mid-South Wrestling, and the Memphis territory. As a demonstration of his domination, he would often demand a five-count from the referee after successfully defeating his opponent at the count of three.
In 1985, he began his prominent run in the WWF, feuding with top stars like Andre the Giant and Hulk Hogan, and forming an imposing tag team with Big John Studd under the managerial guidance of Bobby Heenan.
After leaving the WWF in 1995, Bundy became one of the most popular stars on the independent circuit. He wrestled for several different promotions, headlining and drawing fans from all over the world, until he officially retired from the ring in 2007....[See More]

Ludvig Borga Character Profile - Updated by bbblackwell
Saturday, October 19, 2019
Tony Halme began his career in boxing before being trained by Verne Gagne for professional wrestling. He made his debut in 1990 for the UWF as “The Viking”, and also wrestled in New Japan Pro-Wrestling, where he was given great opportunity to showcase his powerhouse style.
In 1993, he entered the WWF as “Ludvig Borga”; the disgruntled Finn who had harsh words for the American audience. He quickly captured the Intercontinental Title, and went on to feud with Lex Luger at the height of his popularity. Only six months into his promising WWF run, however, he sustained a debilitating injury, and was forced to leave the company soon after.
Halme later wrestled for the German/Austrian CWA, where he held their World Heavyweight Championship for over a year. He retired from wrestling in 1997....[See More]

Run-Over Character Profile - Updated by DAMartin
Saturday, October 19, 2019
Run-Over was a Mini-Con created by Unicron and given to Nemesis Prime. As Nemesis Prime resembles Optimus Prime, so Run-Over was formed to resemble Prime's occasional Mini-Con partner, Over Run. It is possible that Over Run was chosen as a template because of his significance to Unicron, but this is only conjecture....[See More]
