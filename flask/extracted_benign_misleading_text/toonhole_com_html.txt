BIG NEWS…
Hi degenerates (aka ToonHole readers)! After over 7 years of releasing comics 3 days a week, conventions, book releases, long format comics, and animated cartoons, we’ve amassed an audience larger than we ever thought possible. As a matter of fact, we here at ToonHole HQ have finally achieved what we believe is the next chapter in our story of success! ToonHole’s achievements and profits over time have finally allowed us the opportunity to continue living the fat cat lifestyle we’ve become accustomed to while offering you only TWO COMICS A WEEK from here on out! That’s right, the old Mon-Wed-Fri schedule is a thing of the past and now MONDAY and FRIDAY will be your only two favorite days of the week (sorry Wednesday)! It is our hope that with this new schedule you’ll have greater anticipation and appreciation for the now slightly less frequent published content.
If some of you are worried with how you’ll cope with less ToonHole per week, fret not! You can add ToonHole and each individual artist to your social media feed! Where you’ll get your fill of throwback comics you may have missed, behind the scenes action, and other distractions to keep you from achieving your goals.

Working on Website Upgrades
Hey there Toonholigans! As some of our return viewers may have noticed the site looks a bit different.
We’re currently hard at work on some website upgrades (visually and under the hood). It’s gonna be a long term process but we think it will ultimately be worth it; faster website load times, better mobile view, and ultimately better overall navigation for archives and story modes.
Please be patient while we’re hard at work and please feel free to message us on our CONTACT US page or simply leave us a comment here or anywhere on the site (trust us, we’ve read nearly all of them) and let us know if you find any strange bugs or portals into the matrix!
Thanks gang!

SEASON RECAP!
Welp, that’s a wrap for our SEASON 2! Hope you guys enjoyed some of the films, comics and contests we had! It’s back to our regular scheduled content from here on out.
Here’s a Season Recap in case you missed anything! First up we had the Alzheimer’s Cop cartoon: http://toonhole.com/2016/04/alzheimers-cop/
Then we tossed out a hilariously frustrating film called Pissed: http://toonhole.com/2016/04/pissed/
We followed that up with Dirtbag Planet: http://toonhole.com/2016/04/dirtbag-planet/
Then we dropped a 30 page epic titled “Peace Treaty of Death” starring Dallas T. Washington. You can start the series here: http://toonhole.com/2016/04/dallas-t-washington-page-1/
And lastly we had our 2016 CAPTION CONTEST! We had +150 entries and you can read all of them here: http://toonhole.com/2016/04/caption-contest-2016/
Congrats again to our winner, João Parreira!
Until next time, ToonHooligans! Thanks for watching and stay tuned for more!
Love,
The Gang
