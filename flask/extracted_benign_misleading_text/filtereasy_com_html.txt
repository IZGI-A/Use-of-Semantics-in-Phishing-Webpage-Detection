Great Service
The service is great. Don't have to remember to pick up filters every few months. The only problem encountered has been crushed corners on the filters when the box has been damaged in shipping.

The service is great! Every time a shipment comes we know it's time to change them. We don't have to remember and then go searching for the sizes for our house. It's so convenient!
