“All the tutors are great. Especially, NORM PROKUP(Calculus) stands
out - he is a mathematical genius,
a pedagogical dynamite, he has been a catalyst in my upward progress in Trig and
Precalculus, moving my grade with
the speed of light from "c" to "A".”

“Brightstorm's fun and quirky videos have really helped me transfer
what I've learned into the
classroom directly into results on tests and quizzes. Their test prep vids are a
great alternative to expensive and
time-consuming tutors and tedious online classes. Brightstorm has really helped me
achieve a bright
future!”
