Projector Screens
As HD projectors are being incorporated into schools and universities, the education sales channel has seen a lot of growth in projector screen sales. Elite’s selection of whiteboard-projection screens is the ideal solution and their industry awards testify this. They can be utilized as a dry-erase writing surface during lectures and serve as a theater grade projection screen with matte white and ambient light options available. One of Elite’s signature projector screens is the Insta-DE2. The Insta-DE2 is a pliable dry erase whiteboard-projection screen that can convert entire wall surfaces. Its Versa White material delivers 1.1 gain brightness with a 180-degree viewing angle.
