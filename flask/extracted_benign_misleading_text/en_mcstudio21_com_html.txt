How to shoot?
You have to invent storyboards, before filming, to form an overall picture, not to break the rules of filming
Professional postproduction
What should I do with my video footage?
Often, a person without experience in video making notices errors only after long and exhausting filming. A good video requires not only good post work, but also good preproduction.
Problems?
Often you do not know how to realize your idea, lose the look "from the side", spend a lot of energy and the result does not satisfy you.
We have a lot of experience in postproduction and we know what to do and how to film it so that the footage is good and ready to be processed. We’ve been doing videos since 2008, and we know lots of underwater rocks in video production.
Solve problems
You don’t lose your eye and you can always make your corrections. We would rather not take your video than make you a bad video.
