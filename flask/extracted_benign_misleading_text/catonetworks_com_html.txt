What is your
WAN Transformation challenge?
Complex or Simple?
Network complexity is overloading IT and slowing down the business. It is time to make the network simple.
Managing complex networks built with multiple third-party products is difficult. And, outsourcing complexity to a telco results in a slow and rigid service. Why? because the telcos, like your IT team, have to manage and support products they don’t own or control.
Cato built a cloud-native network from the ground up, as a single, converged cloud service. Because we built it, own it, and run it – service is affordable, changes are quick, expert support is always there, and innovation happens at cloud-speed.
One platform. Gradual deployment.
