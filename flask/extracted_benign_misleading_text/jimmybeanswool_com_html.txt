Jimmy Beans Knocker Blockers
Introducing Knocker Blockers, a stunning pink to purple gradient set of Knit Blockers developed exclusively for Jimmy Beans to support the Knitted Knockers organization. $5 from every purchase goes directly to their cause, which provides knitted breast prosthetics to women who have undergone mastectomies or other procedures to the breast. Purchase of the Knocker Blocker set also gets you download codes to two free patterns that also support breast cancer awareness!
