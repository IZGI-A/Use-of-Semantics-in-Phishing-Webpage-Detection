Our K-6 curriculum is research-based, common core aligned, and comprehensive - with over 300,000 math problems and explanations. But even better, students will feel like they're playing a game.
Our teachers work hand in hand with our designers to make sure math problems and videos are instructive and help students develop ways of thinking about math.
Our game designers add interactivity and incentives, and create a world in which math feels like play. Points, badges, cute monsters...who knew learning could be this enjoyable?
AdaptedMind was created with the simple idea that each child is unique. Our algorithm identifies each student's strengths and weaknesses, and customizes a learning plan accordingly.
Each student starts with a quick pretest. The pretest determines the best starting point in the curriculum for the student.
As students continue to practice on AdaptedMind, we adjust the difficulty of the math automatically. We use data to find and address learning gaps.
AdaptedMind automatically administers formative assessments on new and old skills, assuring that students' mastery of topics is robust.
If a student ever misses a problem, one of our teachers explains it to them in a video.
This ensures your child can work independently without ever getting stuck.
With AdaptedMind, it's easy to see student progress. Our reports are simple, intuitive and actionable.
And if you'd like, we can send them straight to your inbox.
