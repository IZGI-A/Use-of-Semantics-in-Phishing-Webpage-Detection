Uniden Bearcat SDS200 Police Scanner
The All New Revolutionary Scanner!
This true I/Q Scanner is the first scanner to incorporate Software Defined Radio technology to provide incredible digital performance in even the most challenging RF environments. The SDS100â€™s digital performance is better than any other scanner in both simulcast and weak-signal environments. This is the first scanner to signal the end of the notorious digital trunking simulcast distortion problem.
