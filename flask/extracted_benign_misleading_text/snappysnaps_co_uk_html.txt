Very quick service for collection time to suit me. Helpful and knowledgeable staff. Thank you
Having been asked by my Regional Manager to get our Regions Action Plan printed and bound I went straight to Snappy Snaps where Paul Reeves is the manager, I met with Miguel and Jacob who gave me great confidence that they would be able to deliver my request in record time. They did an excellent job for me within an hour which was amazing. Thank you Snappy Snaps
Took my son for a photo shoot on a few occasions and the staff was patient and friendly every time. The pictures was amazing better than I expected
They worked hard to take my picture that complied with regulations. A friend had passport photo taken elsewhere and had his rejected by the passport office. I will only go here for my passport and visa photos.
I have just been to your Walworth Rd branch. I am in my seventies and had trouble using a tablet to download some pictures. The manager could not have been more patient and helpful explaining everything I had to do. Excellent service and excellent pictures. Thank you....
