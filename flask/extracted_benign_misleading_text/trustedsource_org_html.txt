McAfeeÂ® provides an online tool that enables you to check if a site is categorized within various versions of the SmartFilter Internet Database or the Webwasher URL Filter Database. After you check a URL, this tool also allows you to suggest an alternative categorization for a site. These requests will be addressed within an average of 3-5 business days with some requests requiring additional review and taking longer.
Note: this Web-based service is designed for occasional use by individuals. If you have hundreds or thousand of
URLs you would like to test, please write to us about your needs. Most often, we can provide timely analysis of
your request. If we see heavy use of this Web-based service by automated programs, we reserve the right to
deny access.
Please email us at sites@mcafee.com and we will gladly work with you.
