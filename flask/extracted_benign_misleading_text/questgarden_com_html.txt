Guided Inquiry Made Semi-Easy
The WebQuest model has been around since 1995 when I developed it for use in a course
at San Diego State University. The goal then, and now, was to create lessons that
make good use of the web, engage learners in applying higher level thinking to
authentic problems, and use everyone's time well. Since that beginning, one of
the ongoing challenges has been to make it faster and easier for teachers to do
all these things. QuestGarden is the end result of those 22 years of effort.

Who is this Site For?
If
you're looking for a way to go beyond rote learning and disengaged learners. this
is the place for you. QuestGarden is useful for pre-service teachers, working teachers,
and the professional developers and teacher educators who work with them. The lessons
created on this site are available for use by educators everywhere. Instructors
of courses and workshops can request that a group
page be set up so that participants can give feedback to each other as they develop
new WebQuests. A free
30-day trial of the lesson creation tools is available and a 1-year
