Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Common Entrance Test (AME CET) is the national-level common entrance exam to offer admission for Aircraft Maintenance Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, and Aeronautical Engineering courses in approved Institutes.
An aircraft is made of numerous parts, engines, electrical, and electronic systems etc. Designing of aircraft is a complex task which is performed by the experts. Aeronautical Engineering is the engineering branch that deals with the designing and manufacturing of aircraft within the Earth’s atmosphere. Aerospace Engineering is the branch combines the designing and manufacturing of aircraft within the Earth atmosphere as well as outside the Earth atmosphere. Safety is an important aspect when it comes to the aviation sector. With time and use, parts tend to wear and tear down.
