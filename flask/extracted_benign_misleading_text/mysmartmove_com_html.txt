SmartMove is very convenient to use. I like that the process is all online, the speed and accuracy of the reports, and that the service is backed by a company as well respected as TransUnion. I had much more confidence after using SmartMove that the tenant I picked would be excellent – and they were, always paid on-time and were responsible tenants.

Screening tenants used to be just for large professional property management companies. It's easy to understand why: pulling certain types of tenant background checks like tenant credit reports isn't possible for most individuals. This includes resident screening for many rental property owners, real estate agents and even small property management companies.
TransUnion changed that with the patented SmartMove tenant screening product, adding convenience and wide accessibility into tenant background checks.
In a nutshell, SmartMove allows rental history reports to be delivered to the landlord (or rental property owner, real estate agent or whoever is in charge of screening applicants) while protecting consumer information in a manner consistent with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and applicable regulations.
And… these tenant background checks are completely paperless and online. It's free to sign up for an account. Accounts can be created and screening reports delivered in a matter of minutes. Enjoy free membership with SmartMove’s pay-as-you go tenant screening. Only pay for the reports you need. Additionally, SmartMove enables landlords the choice to pay themselves or pass the cost of background screening onto tenants.
A key to picking out the right renter is to have quality tenant background check information, including an eviction history check, to help you make your decision.
This is where TransUnion SmartMove is best:
And, TransUnion SmartMove tenant screening services offers exclusive benefits and features that are designed to help landlords make more informed decisions.
Along with tenant screening reports, SmartMove delivers a credit-based recommendation based on the applicant's ResidentScore.
A landlord credit check is an important step to evaluate your applicant. And, we know you base your leasing decision on more than just a credit profile or renter balance sheet. But as a consumer reporting agency, TransUnion leverages its decades of experience to offer ResidentScore 2.0, a credit score tailored specifically for the rental industry, helping you better assess an applicant's risk. Use credit checks designed for tenant screening and find high-quality tenants faster with SmartMove screening services.
SmartMove rental background checks are great for both landlord and tenant. A TransUnion tenant background check allows your applicants to share their histories while also protecting their personal identifying information. Renters who use SmartMove tenant screening services submit their personal information directly to TransUnion online, without having to provide sensitive information (such as a social security number) to the landlord. Ultimately, they like our services because we help them get the rental they want while making them feel comfortable in sharing their personal information in a convenient, online solution.
*According to TransUnion's research, ResidentScore predicts evictions 15% more often in comparison to a typical credit score in the bottom 20% score range where risk is highest.
**The Criminal Report is subject to federal, state and local laws which may limit or restrict SmartMove's ability to return some records.
