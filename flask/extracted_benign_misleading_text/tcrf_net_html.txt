The Cutting Room Floor
The Cutting Room Floor is a site dedicated to unearthing and researching unused and cut content from video games. From debug menus, to unused music, graphics, enemies, or levels, many games have content never meant to be seen by anybody but the developers â€” or even meant for everybody, but cut due to time/budget constraints.
Feel free to browse our collection of games and start reading. Up for research? Try looking at some stubs and see if you can help us out. Just have some faint memory of some unused menu/level you saw years ago but can't remember how to access it? Feel free to start a page with what you saw and we'll take a look. If you want to help keep this site running and help further research into games, feel free to donate.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
Developer: Nintendo
Publisher: Nintendo
Released: 1998, Nintendo 64
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was the long awaited three-dimensional Zelda adventure, and the first Nintendo 64 Zelda game. It had a development time of three years, and the only limiting factor in its development were the limitations of the Nintendo 64 console, which forced them to cut out lots of things.
The in-game cutscenes hide some canned ideas and suggestions which are normally hidden to the player, and the large game script also has some surprises hidden inside. These tell a lot about what the developers originally had in mind...
