We are a global community conservation organization that advances the vision and work of Dr. Jane Goodall. By protecting chimpanzees and inspiring people to conserve the natural world we all share, we improve the lives of people, animals and the environment. Everything is connected—everyone can make a difference.
Our Work
In 1900, an estimated 1 million chimpanzees lived in the wild.
Today, there are as few as 340,000.
We’re on a mission to save chimpanzees from extinction. Together, we can turn these numbers around.
Q: While observing the chimpanzees in Gombe, what type of shoes did Jane wear most often?
A: Low-top canvas sneakers (but she mostly went barefoot).
