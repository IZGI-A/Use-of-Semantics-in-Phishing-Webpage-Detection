Don't waste your time installing, configuring and running complex security tools. We have them all setup for you, just say what is your target and press the Start button. You will receive a friendly report containing detailed vulnerability information, including risk description, evidence and recommendations for improvement.
All the scanners from our platform can be scheduled to periodically test your systems for vulnerabilities. Since our tools are regularly updated, you can be sure that you don't miss critical vulnerabilities. The scan reports are sent directly to your inbox so you can quickly react when issues are found.
Information gathering is crucial for planning a penetration test and for estimating the amount of work to be done. We have powerful reconnaissance tools which allow you to quickly discover the attack surface of an organization, passively scan for vulnerabilities and find the most promising targets.
Even if you have all the tools on your machine, the local firewall of your network might block you from scanning external hosts. The only way around this is to scan from an external server and Pentest-Tools.com was designed just for that. Our servers have a fast and direct Internet connection.
If you are a web development or an IT services company, you can easily use our platform to show your clients that you have correctly implemented all the necessary security measures. Our results are trusted by more than 50.000 clients in 40+ countries.
The API that we provide allows you to easily integrate the tools from our platform into your own systems and processes. This way you will benefit of the powerful scanning engines without having the trouble of running such scanners yourself.

“With several offices dotted around the world and 3 brands with multiple websites, I needed a solution that allowed me to monitor potential vulnerabilities across our business. We started with manual scans but now rely on the scheduling services for all our offices and websites to alert us of any issues. We’ve come to use the dashboard as a point of reference every day as part of our daily checks and we wouldn’t be without it. As long as Pentest-Tools.com continue to improve the scans and add new types of scans as the security landscape adapts, they’ll continue to have my business.”
