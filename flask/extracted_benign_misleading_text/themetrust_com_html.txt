Customer Testimonial
"I used a premium WordPress theme from ThemeTrust to create a site that showcases my creative work in advertising. The theme is perfect for my purpose. It's simple, elegant, functional and puts the spotlight on my work rather than drawing attention to itself. I'm really happy with the whole experience!"

New to WordPress?
You probably have a few questions.
What is WordPress?
If you're here, chances are you have at least heard of WordPress. But perhaps you're still not quite sure what it is or what it does. WordPress is a free open source content management system. In plain English, it is an online tool that makes creating a website very easy. WordPress is the fastest growing CMS. Nearly 500+ new websites are built with WordPress every day and it powers over 10 million websites.
How do I get started with WordPress?
To get started with a WordPress site, the first thing you need is hosting. There are plenty of web hosts out there, but they are not all created equal. We recommend SiteGround and Kinsta. Both of these offer a one click WordPress setup, making it easy to get your WordPress website up and running. We've written a review on Kinsta and a tutorial on how to start a blog on SiteGround.
What's a WordPress Theme?
A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a website. That's the official definition from the WordPress.org site, but you probably want the non-geek definition. Basically, a WordPress theme makes your site look amazing. That is if it is a theme like one of ours.
A theme uses styles and templates to present your content in an aesthetic way. Themes can also give you tools and settings for customizing the look and feel of your site. Our themes do all of the above, and much more.
