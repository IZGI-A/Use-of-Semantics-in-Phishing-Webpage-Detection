I have been a long-time user of WebSitePulse, so the jump to the new system was not a complicated one. I have been extremely pleased with your offerings, especially the value for price paid - it is unparalleled as near as I can tell.
I have yet to find another provider that even comes close to offering the same services even close to the same prices. Thanks to everyone at WebSitePulse for making IT easier for me :)
