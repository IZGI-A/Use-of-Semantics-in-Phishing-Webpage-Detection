Since January 2017, the Transatlantic Cluster for Lightweighting has been supporting the international expansion and networking of German and North American companies and research centers. The goal is to bring together technical know-how for the development of truly unique and innovative lightweighting products through collaborative R&D projects between Germany, the USA and Canada.
For now the cluster focuses on the areas of “additive manufacturing of metal components”, “joining techniques for multi-material design” and “fiber composite materials & hybrid structures” but is open to further development. The resulting projects will be financed on the German side by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.
As a transatlantic platform, TraCLight offers affiliated companies access to the world‘s largest research institutes in the lightweighting sector such as the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT/FAST), Lightweighting Innovations for Tomorrow (lift®), Institute for Advanced Composite Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI), Waterloo Center for Automotive Research (WatCar) at the University of Waterloo, Fraunhofer Projekt Center at Western University Ontario.
