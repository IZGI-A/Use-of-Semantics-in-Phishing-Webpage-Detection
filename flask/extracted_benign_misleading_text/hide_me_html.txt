What Can hide.me VPN Do For You?
Advanced Security
We protect your Internet connection by encrypting your data so you can safely surf the web whether you are at home, work or in public.
Absolute Privacy
Surf the internet privately while keeping your real IP hidden. Keep your location anonymous and stop your internet service provider from spying on you.
Liberty
Avoid annoying censorship and access any website, app or channel safely. Make your way around government or workplace limitations and enjoy the internet with liberty.
Stay fast
We always wanted to build a VPN service that you couldn't feel. That's why we offer gigabit speeds and use cutting-edge hardware and software, some of it custom built by us to do the job.
No Log VPN. Zero. Nada
We're dead serious about this one: we do not store logs of your online activity. Logs can easily link actions back to you, and some VPN providers pass these onto law officials when told to do so. We can't, as we don't have any. Simple.
Feel the simplicity
Unlike other VPN providers, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to get started with hide.me. Use one of our helpful guides to setup your device and get protected in a few minutes.
