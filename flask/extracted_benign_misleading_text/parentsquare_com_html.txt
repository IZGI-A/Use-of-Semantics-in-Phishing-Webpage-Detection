NO HIDDEN FEES
ParentSquare‚Äôs transparent pricing bundles all these features together so you won‚Äôt be hit with unexpected fees.
Smarter Alerts & Notifications That Reach All
OPTIONS FOR ‚ÄúOPT-OUTS‚Äù AS WELL AS ‚ÄúOPT-IN‚Äù
Provides options for both ‚Äúopt-in‚Äù and ‚Äúopt-out.‚Äù Intelligently managed opt-outs* results in a much larger parent reach.
SMARTER ALERT CALLS
Schools have the option of sending ‚ÄúSmart Alerts,‚Äù where a text is sent to parents first with automatic failover to voice.
SEND ALERTS WITH 3 TAPS OR WITH SIRI
Powerful Template Message Library allows you to notify your entire community with 3 taps on your mobile phone.
REAL-REACH REPORTS
Each report filters through all modes of communication and every parent contact so you know exactly which student families did not receive the communication.
ALERTS ON PARENT APP AND WEB PORTAL
Alerts integrate with our app & web portal, blasting out through all modes of communication, ensuring parents are notified quickly in an emergency situation.
*At the beginning of the school year, you collect parent contact info with permission to notify them regarding school information. Coupling this with opt-out is still TCPA compliant, as parents give initial consent when they provide their information, and they can opt-out at any time.
‚ÄúParentSquare is hands-down the best investment our district has made when it comes to engaging and communicating with students, parents and staff. We have been able to raise the reach and frequency to our stakeholders. Our principals and school office supervisors all rave about its ease of use, and our families appreciate the various ways in which to receive info via posts, emails, texts, app, website or all call.‚Äù
