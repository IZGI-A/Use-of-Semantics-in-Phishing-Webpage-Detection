5/3/1 Forever
5/3/1 Forever is all about programming your total training; this includes mobility, jumps/med ball throws, main lifts, supplemental, assistance work, conditioning and recovery. As always, each part is broken down and addressed in a simple, easy to read/implement manner. This allows the athlete or lifter to program their training, no matter what the goals. 5/3/1 Second Edition is a prerequisite read.
Keep your training fresh and moving forward!
