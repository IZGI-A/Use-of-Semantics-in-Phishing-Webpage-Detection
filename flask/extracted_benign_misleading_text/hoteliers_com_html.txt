How we protect personal data
Hoteliers.com takes the protection of your data seriously and takes appropriate measures to prevent misuse, loss, unauthorized access, unwanted disclosure and unauthorized modification. If you feel that your data is not properly protected or there is evidence of abuse, please contact us via support@hoteliers.com.
Below you will find a number of examples of the organizational and technical measures that Hoteliers.com has taken in order to protect your personal data.
Organizational security measures:
- Hiring the right people: Make sure that you check the references of applicants, so that you can trust them with personal details of your guests.
- Confidentiality statement: Ensure that employees sign an agreement so that they are safe with personal details of your guests.
- Train all employees: Ensure that all employees are trained in the security of personal data and in the security measures that your organization has taken to prevent unauthorized access. Password protection is also an important part of this training.
- Clean desk policy: Make sure there are no papers in the office. Remind employees to keep files with personal data in a locked cabinet. This applies to offices, but especially to public areas such as the reception from the hotel.
- Portable devices: Never leave portable devices, such as smartphones, tablets or laptops, unattended. Always lock your computer when you walk away from your desk. Never leave a portable device in your car (thieves now even have one trackers who can see if a portable device remains in the boot of a car).
- Printed documents: Do not throw documents with personal data into the trash can, just use a paper shredder. Prevent as much as possible that you take paper documents outside the office.
- Secure the office: Make sure you have the best possible security. Make sure there is access control, so that unwanted visitors cannot come to the office. This applies to offices, but especially to public areas such as the reception, spa or restaurant of the hotel.
- Report Data breach: This is a security incident where personal data was possibly lost or unintentionally accessible to third parties. Hoteliers.com has made agreements with partners that the reporting of a possible Data breach is mandatory.
Technical security measures:
Changes to privacy statement
- Access control: Make sure that only people who really need access have access. Does this person really need all administrator rights? Think of Privacy by Design and give users that way minimal access.
- Do not share accounts: Never share accounts with your colleagues, because it will then be impossible to show via which account any information has been leaked. Most systems are on users manage, the manager ask for a create account for each new employee.
- Strong passwords: Because users have to remember a lot of passwords, they come up with passwords such as "Welcome123 @" or "JanDeBoer1983!". These passwords can be cracked within a few minutes.
- Use a password manager: Use a password management system to make your life easy. It also allows you to securely share passwords with colleagues (if there is no way to create individual user accounts).
- Virus scanner: Make sure your virus scanner is set to automatically download updates every day.
- USB sticks: Do not use USB sticks, as this is a common reason for data leaks or virus infections. Instead, use solutions for sharing documents, such as Dropbox or WeTransfer.
- Secure access to your computer and smartphone: A four-digit code is insufficient and can be hacked within a few hours. Change your password in at least six digits. Also make sure that you activate tracking apps such as Find My iPhone.
- Two-factor authentication: Many systems offer two-factor authentication. When you log in with your password, a code is sent to your smartphone to make sure you are genuine.
- E-mail: Activate two-factor authentication if possible. Do not open messages that you do not expect. Do not open attachments that you do not expect. Ask your system administrator if your e-mail is being sent encrypted.
- TLS, formerly SSL: We send your data via a secure internet connection. You can see this at the address bar 'https' and the padlock in the address bar.
- DKIM, DMARC, and SPF: These are three internet standards that we use to prevent our domain name from being misused to send e-mails containing viruses, spam or which are intended to obtain personal (login) data.
We reserve the right to change the privacy statement . Changes will be published on https://company.hoteliers.com.
