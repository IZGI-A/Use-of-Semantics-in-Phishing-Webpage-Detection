Hello Minions,
As of today GW2Minion supports the Shared Inventory slots!!
Finally the option you have all been asking for, share food or (infinite) salvage tools between all your characters!
And we would also like to remind everyone that GW2Minion supports movement using the mount!
This means you can use your mount to run around a lot faster, and speed up whatever task you are doing![ Read More ]
