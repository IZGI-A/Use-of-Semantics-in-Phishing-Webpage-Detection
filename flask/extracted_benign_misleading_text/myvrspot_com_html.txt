I’ve been happy with MyVRSpot for years and they have been consistent. The fact that I can pick up the phone and a human being will answer and help me is impressive.
The entire MyVRSpot staff is, hands-down, the best customer service based company I work with. No problem is too small or too big, and any problem is resolved quickly. They provide templates, a way to stay ADA compliant with videos, and also provide easy access for live streaming.
We use MyVRSpot to solve our own department problems and to make our jobs easier. We’re happy that it makes us more effective.
