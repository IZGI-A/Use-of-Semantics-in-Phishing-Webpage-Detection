In April, D.A.P. published 'Landscape Painting Now,' a big, bold and deceptively smart global survey of the genre that's been on our bestseller list ever since. We sat down to speak with the book's editor, Todd Bradway, this week to discuss the three-year process of making of the book, painting in general, and his steady rise from scrappy D.A.P. intern in 1994 to one of the most respected art book makers working today.
ELISA NADEL | DATE 6/5/2019
Andrea Albertini, a prominent figure in photographic publishing who founded and ran Damiani, has passed away in his hometown of Bologna, Italy, after a sustained illness that he fought courageously. Andrea was especially well known for his passion for photography, which he pursued with a unique vision and sensibility.

We will miss Carolee Schneemann, fearless performance artist, painter, filmmaker, feminist and innate breaker of taboos. She died this week at the age of 79. In memoriam, we present an excerpt from 'Carolee Schneemann: Uncollected Texts,' published by Primary Information.

Nan Goldin still speaks volumes in 'MoMA Now'
Nan Goldin's Nan and Brian in Bed, New York City (1983) is reproduced from MoMA Now, published to accompany The Museum's expanded, radical rehang, which opened this week. One of more than 700 color images in Goldin's 1985 slideshow, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency, as well as the cover image for the artist's seminal 1987 artist's book of the same name, it is not only a game-changing work of art, but a visceral icon of downtown Manhattan's 80s underground scene. "While the work captures the shared experience of a generation ravaged by drug excesses and AIDS, its central, driving theme is the intensity—the highs and the lows—of amorous relationships," the curators write.
