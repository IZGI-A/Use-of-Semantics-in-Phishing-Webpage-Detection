Baby Blanket Hat
Hi everybody,
I wanted to knit a hat for one of the grandkids out of baby blanket yarn. I wanted a simple hat to make and in Stephanie Pearl-McPheeÃ¢s book â€˜Knitting Rulesâ€™ there are directions for a simple hat using two straight needles. I made that. I will have to make another one for his brother, I might want one myself. I was hoping to have both done by the 2nd of November when their birthday party is. We shall see.
Knitted Pocket sized gnome (K)
Ran him up tonight just for fun. Hope you like him.
Beret and Mitts.
My first item towards a charity donation.
Pattern is from Sirdar Baby in Aran booklet 225.
My First Cuddly
This little girl is a sweetie. I will knit a couple more items to take to the market to test the waters as Chuck put it. That makes a lot of sense to me. I have the utmost and most profound admiration for all of you knitters and crocheters who can knit many many similar items all in a row. I have seen 20 and more hats or toys in one post and they are all exquisite. Congratulations to all of you. I am thinking that I will do this one weekend and then that will be it. Knitting for people I love brings me great joy. We'll see how the first sale goes.
Finally it's back !
I lost my knitting mojo at the end of April. Yesterday it came back and about time too as this years knitting goal is completely ruined. I had planned on knitting two adult hats per week for the homeless. Never mind as I am happy to be able to knit again.
I guess I shouldn't have counted my chicken before they hatched eh.
ðŸ˜Š I really enjoyed all those books I read though ðŸ˜Š
Scrappy Blanket for donation
Will take this with me on Mon for my group to donate. We make them for pediatric cancer patients. It's made from bits & pieces the group gives me that are left from other blankets. None of them like working with small bits of yarn. I don't mind. Thanks for looking.
you have enough
Whew I thought it was going to say yarn.
Toddler / Child Sweater
I found this pattern a few days ago and thought it would be worth sharing. I've always held back from trying to knit a fairisle sweater, they always look so complicated. This little jumper is worked flat on two needles, the four completed pieces are then joined at the shoulders so the stitches can be picked up on a straight needle and the yoke worked flat. If like me you are not to clever with circular knitting then this is the answer. A lovely little design that uses UK double knit yarn or the equivalent. I have tried to add the link to the web site I purchased this pattern but haven't been able to do so. Google cabbage patch treasures and you will get to the site.
Do You Knit Seasonally?
I rarely knit in the warmer weather. Spring is for starting seeds in the greenhouse, summer is for gardening and early Fall for canning!
Then when the cooler weather comes in I like sewing and knitting!
My problem is I have too many hobbies I enjoy doing!
Do you have other hobbies besides kniting/crochet? Do you do all year long?
