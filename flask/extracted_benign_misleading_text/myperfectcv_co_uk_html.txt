CV services – customer reviews
I found your site very easy to use and brilliant in the options I could choose to suit the type of CV I needed to create. The CV I created was professional and the advice I chose to use made it a winning CV. I also really appreciated the lack of hard sell and the ease with which I have been able to cancel the account until I need it again. I will definitely use this site again in the future and will recommend it to friends and family.”

Very useful, nice templates and I really like the fact you make it easy to cancel. Sometimes more often than not, companies make this a difficult process. It's nice to see My Perfect CV works transparently. Because of this fact, I will be back should I ever need to work on my CV again.”
