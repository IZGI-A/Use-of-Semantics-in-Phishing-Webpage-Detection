Your ticket to family fun!
For over 45 years, Carowinds has been right at the heart of where the Carolinas come together, so we know a thing or two about Carolina culture. It's something mighty special and we want you to see (and taste and experience) just why we love it here.
World-Class Rides
Grab a buddy and scream out loud on one of our 14 world-class rollercoasters or explore our kidsâ€™ area - Camp Snoopy - filled with fun for the entire family. With over 60 rides, shows and attractions, there is something for every member of the family.
