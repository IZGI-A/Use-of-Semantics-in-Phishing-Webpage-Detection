Established in 2002, Online Betting Guide began as a guide to the best betting sites and latest offers with information to help sports bettors place bets online.
These were the early days of online betting, with bet365 having only been established online during the previous year. Back then most people in the UK were betting at high street betting shops such as William Hill. Placing online bets was a new experience and not that easy as many of the early online betting sites were pretty hard to use!
Early on a tipster competition was added to the site, followed by an online betting forum and both became very popular. This allowed Online Betting Guide to build a knowledgeable community of sports bettors who wanted to a share their expertise and help others to improve their betting. Online Betting Guide became more popularly known as OLBG, The Sports Betting Community.
Whilst the most popular UK betting sports of Football and Horse Racing have always been well provided for, OLBG has grown to cover more than 20 sports, hundreds of leagues and thousands of events. OLBG runs the largest and most advanced tipping competition in the World. Significantly OLBG has grown and retained the best tipsters of any sports betting community.
Over 500,000 online sports bettors have joined OLBG. More than 43,000 tipster competition prizes have been won, with over £650,000 of prizes shared. Many members have made great friends, whether that friendship has remained online or through meeting up at the many offline events OLBG has arranged.
Betting strategy is also a huge topic of discussion on the site with some members writing some fantastic articles and sharing them through the OLBG blogs section. We try to keep member content at the heart of all we do. As you explore the site you will see that whether it is in the strategy guides, the bookmaker reviews or the betting school lessons, our members knowledge and experiences are shared to help you to improve your knowledge and enjoyment of online betting.
"Let's Beat The Bookies" became a strapline which resonated with both those who seek out our great tips content and those who provide it.
Many people refer to "beating the bookies" when they have a winning bet, just like they talk about "losing to the bookies" when they have a losing bet.
OLBG takes responsible gambling seriously and we urge our users to never bet more than they can afford to lose.
Sports bettors need good betting sites, betting exchanges and spread betting sites to place their bets online.
With our users help we have built some great content to help people to choose the online betting sites which are best for them. Our regular sports bettors share their knowledge and real life experiences of online betting sites by adding real user reviews and discussing them on the forum.
There are now over 80 licensed bookmakers in the UK so this information is really useful. Our users are finding that many of the new betting sites offer them something different.
More recently, OLBG has expanded to also provide betting guides for casino. You can see a list of top UK casino sites as well as free spins offers for slots players.
As the use of mobile phones grew, OLBG invested in building fantastic app products to showcase the great tips provided by our tipsters. First an iOS sports betting tips app and then an Android version for the UK, later expanding into 18 other countries. The OLBG app to hit an amazing 1 million installs this year and it still carries average star ratings of around 4.5 out of 5 across the stores.
As social media has taken off, OLBG has found it’s place on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and Instagram where we also show off the incredible tips from the tipsters we have in our community.
