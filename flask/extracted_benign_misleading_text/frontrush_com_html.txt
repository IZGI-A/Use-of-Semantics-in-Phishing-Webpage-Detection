Whether coaches are accessing Front Rush from a laptop or mobile device, the system will proactively alert users prior to any violation. This includes outgoing calls, emails, evals, contacts, and even text messages.

Create and Track Compliance Events
When creating an event, coaches can mark it as a compliance event which will then be tracked in their CARA log and made available for reporting.
