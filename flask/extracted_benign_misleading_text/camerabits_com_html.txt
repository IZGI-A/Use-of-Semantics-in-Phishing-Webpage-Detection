Photo Mechanic is open on my desktop every single day that I’m working. It’s my “go to” program that I use all the time. It’s fast and simple, and absolutely brilliant for culling, applying caption information, and downloading to two different locations at once. The ingesting is fast as it downloads multiple cards at once. I love that I can adjust the size, resolution, rename the image, place a watermark on the image, etc., all while emailing, moving, coping, and/or saving images. It’s crazy cool and a program that I can’t live without!
