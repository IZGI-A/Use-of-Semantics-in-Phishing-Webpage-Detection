In a society increasingly determined to erode that right, a fast, trustworthy and easy-to-use VPN is a good first step toward reclaiming it.
When you connect to the internet with Mullvad, we ensure that the traffic to and from your computer is encrypted to the highest standards even if you are using a public WiFi network at a cafe or hotel.
We keep no activity logs, do not ask for personal information, and even encourage anonymous payments via cash or one of the cryptocurrencies we accept. Your IP address is replaced by one of ours, ensuring that your device's activity and location are not linked to you.
Using Mullvad is straightforward and simple – just download and install the app. You won't need to waste time with setup configurations or a multi-step registration process. We built Mullvad with ease of use in mind.
Privacy is fundamental to a well-functioning society because it allows norms, ethics, and laws to be safely discussed and challenged. Without privacy, a free and open society can neither flourish nor exist.
That is why we provide a VPN service that helps keep your online activity, identity, and location private for only €5/month.
The account number is the only thing you need to connect to Mullvad VPN. We ask for no email, no phone number, no personal information whatsoever.
It's only €5 per month for peace-of-mind privacy. With your account, you can have up to 5 simultaneous connections.
Your time is precious, so why waste it on difficult setup configurations? Download the Mullvad VPN app, enter your account number, and you're ready to roll.
When protecting your online privacy, no single-step solution exists. Instead, it is about changing your habits and using certain tools. Read our guide.
