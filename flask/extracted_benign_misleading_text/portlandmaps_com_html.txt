Assessor Data Discrepancies
For more information regarding how to change assessor data discrepancies like property ownership name and improvements for properties in Multnomah County, please contact Multnomah County Assessment, Recording & Taxation at (503) 988-3326 or dartcs@multco.us. The division's ownership section can also review requests to remove a name based on some limited public safety provisions.
Building Permits & Assessment Timeline
Building permits are worked by the Multnomah County Assessment, Recording & Taxation office in the year following issuance. The assessment date for a property is January 1st of each year. If a house was not built prior to January 1 then you will not see anything updated on the record until the following year. Assessment values are not finalized until mid-September of each year following the January 1 assessment date. Once the appraiser has done the site visit and inspection, it typically is only a few weeks until the records are updated.
