from rust to polished
Chris’ Garage is in the business of restoring and reviving “Cars That Count” – especially the body shells. We handle complete restorations, from takedown to re-assembly. But our true niche market is in the process of renewing bare body shells for the guys who like to do the rest themselves. This includes submersion stripping and de-rusting, structural and body panel repairs, making it appear that no work of this kind had ever been necessary on the inside, outside, or underneath. The highest quality of paint finish is then applied and polished out to look like the body was dipped in molten glass. We hand our customers the finished car or the fresh body shell for those who like to do the fun part – bolting it back together. When you get down to it, the body and paint is what initially attracts people to your car, and it can also repel them if it’s not done right. We’ve been doing this since 1971 and we do it right!
