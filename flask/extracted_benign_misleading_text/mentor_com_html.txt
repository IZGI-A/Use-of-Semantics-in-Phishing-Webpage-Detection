White Papers and Case Studies
Embedded Multicore: Enablement of Heterogeneous OSes and Mixed Criticality SystemsWhite Paper
The implementation of multicore embedded systems is becoming increasingly common. The decision to realize a design using multiple processors may be influenced by a number of factors; broadly these...
Hierarchical DFT in a RISC-V ProcessorWhite Paper
The RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) is the only processor with a completely open source instruction set, and is supported by a broad industry ecosystem of at least 70 companies. The use of RISC-V...
Building a Better Virtual Sequence with Portable StimulusWhite Paper
Good virtual sequences are challenging to create, and even more challenging to reuse in a way not explicitly intended by the original author. Portable stimulus can make creating virtual sequences easier,...
Shorten the time between P&R and physical verification with Calibre PVReady filler cell solutionWhite Paper
Using a P&R tool’s built-in fill function to place filler cells during implementation is not only time-consuming, but can create layouts that do not comply with design requirements. The Calibre...
Finding a perfect balance between flexibility and quality in SRAM layoutsWhite Paper
SRAM verification is a challenging, yet critical part of SoC tape-outs. The challenge for SoC designers at advanced nodes is to balance their need to customize SRAM blocks to obtain better performance,...
Reliability verification for AI and ML processorsWhite Paper
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are seeing growing adoption in a wide range of applications. ICs used for AI/ML applications are characterized by large parallel processing computation units,...
It’s Not My Fault! How to Run a Better Fault Campaign Using FormalWhite Paper
This paper describes how to run a better ISO 26262 fault campaign using formal verification. The ISO 26262 automotive safety standard requires evaluation of safety goal violations due to random hardware...
Simplifying Assertion Validation Using UVM CallbacksWhite Paper
This paper covers how callbacks implemented in Questa Verification IP can be used for assertion validation in designs using the PCIe® protocol.
5G Verification is Impossible without EmulationWhite Paper
Emulation, combined with a rich assortment of virtualized versions of the many protocols that 5G will require, is the only practical way of ensuring that the first round of silicon built will be the production...
