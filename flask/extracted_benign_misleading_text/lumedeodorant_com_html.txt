I Love the subtle, clean smell. Did Zumba, ran a 5K, 34-mile bike, and 30-minute core; did not have to reapply – no kidding!
This is a winner, will continue to purchase.

I recently tried a baking soda based “natural” deodorant and it felt (and looked) like someone had taken a flamethrower to my armpits! In contrast, Lume doesn’t irritate and it performs exactly as advertised. Highly recommended.

I love this stuff. I no longer stink… anywhere! A few times I’ve gone longer than 24 hours without reapplying. Unreal.
Love this stuff. I’m a believer.
