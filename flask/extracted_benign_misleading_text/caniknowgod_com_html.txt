My desire to know who God is began early in life. It was a rocky and unrewarding road at first.
I was born in Ohio in 1938. My father, Reg Beckett, had recently begun his own manufacturing business, in the basement of our home, making products to help people heat their homes. He worked very hard but managed to find time for family.
Following high school I decided to follow my dad into engineering, and was able to attend Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). Though church didn't top my list of outside activities, I regularly attended Sunday morning services in Boston.
I now realize I was searching. I believed in God, but had many unanswered questions. Especially the most important ones: Can I know God personally? How do I have a relationship with him?
