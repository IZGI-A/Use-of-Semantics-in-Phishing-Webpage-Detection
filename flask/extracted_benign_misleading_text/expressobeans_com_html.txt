Welcome
Expressobeans.com (aka The EB Art Guide) is an art collector's community resource built and maintained by a volunteer staff. We provide a wealth of information about graphic art including dimensions, edition size, medium and technique, eBay auction tracking, past and current sales histories, price averages, and much more. We are committed to free public memberships which include personal collection tracking, buying, selling and trading art, EB's matchmaker function, forums, email notifications, and other options. So welcome! Dive right in and have a look around!
