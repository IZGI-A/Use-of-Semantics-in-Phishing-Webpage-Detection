Thank Grog It’s Firday!
I want to start with a disclaimer right away. This entire post may have been influenced by the fact that I have been inhaling epoxy fumes all week. Kitchen counters and a host of detail additions to the new kitchen remodel will do that. I also admit it. I like the smell. I used to build a lot of model airplanes when I was young. I never huffed…but certainly got happy once or twice putting the clear “dope” sealer on my balsa wood planes. But, I digress…
The real reason for this post should be obvious. It is a clear and pointed op-ed on the state of TSTO, as it appears to signal in this most recent update.
I know I am not alone. But, after trying for months to put on my “happy face” about the game, it is time to be honest…and pragmatic…and serious.

Hey Howdy Hey Tappers!
Halloween has finally arrived in Springfield, but with Kodos and Kang involved will it be full of Treats or lots of Tricks? We’ll have to read the dialogue to find out…
THOH XXX follows the same event structure of the Multi-Events before it. This event consists of 4 parts (or Acts), with each part lasting a week and taking us through a new part of the event!
For Week 1, Act 1, we’re following what happens when Kodos and Kang try to unclog the drain, and take over Springfield! All of the prizes unlocked during week 1 play a role in that storyline.
So let’s take a look at the very first THOH XX Prize…Malicious Krubb.

Hey Howdy Hey Tappers!
Ol’ Gil is back in Springfield. He returned to Springfield yesterday with the arrival of the THOH XXX event. Also always, Gil has another ‘deal” for us. What’s the latest gimmick he’s peddling? Well, this time around he’s offering up God. He’s trying his hardest to make us a deal we can’t refuse…or face eternal damnation…
So let’s break down the details of this latest offer and determine if this deal is worth the donuts or if you want to risk angering God…

I am writing this through gritted teeth. I am doing my best to “put on a happy face,” but it keeps sliding off of my skull. Kinda goulish…and waaaay scarier than this update.
But…we kinda knew this was coming, right?
I’ll leave the proselytizing for the Filler on Friday, after I have had a bit of time to actually “play” this update a bit. But, suffice it to say, there is a smell of burning rubber in the room…coming from my burning opinion of so many “retreads.”
However…we will keep playing…as long as they keep doling out the stuff. Right?
Let’s get to the numbers.

Hey Howdy Hey Tappers!
So I’m a little late to the party on this…my apologies. I was picking kids up from school, feeding them dinner, and getting them ready for bed. But this evening there was an in-game update…as many of you commented…that repaired a few things (Wailing walls and donuts)…

For Act 1 we’re tasked with collecting McGuffin Disks! Each part of the story will unlock another prize themed for the first part of the story. So let’s take a look at the details behind Week 1 and the Turbo Tappin’ Version for Operation Clogged Drain…

Hey Howdy Hey Tappers!
Making a separate post for this so it’s not missed…
If you’re looking for info about Week 1 of the THOH event, go here.
Real quick, Seeing a bunch of reports from you guys that the option to buy $19.99 worth of donuts is either missing or broken. By broken, I mean…you can buy it and spend the money but you’re not given the donuts. If this happens to you contact EA.
Update: Apparently this is happening on multiple donut package sizes. Do just don’t buy donuts right now
If you did buy donuts and are having trouble getting through with EA, you can contact the store (iOS or Google) and let them know what happened. They’ll refund you pretty quickly.
What I can tell you is, it looks like there’s going to be a donut bonus offered with the $19.99 Truckload of donuts during this event. That may explain why it’s missing or you’re having problems with it.
As a warning to others…until this is resolved DO NOT BUY THE 19.99 DONUTS!

Note: The in-game instruction boxes and prize box says items leave November 13th. However, the files say November 19th is when the event ends. I think it’s some dialogue they forgot to change. It looks like this event was originally supposed to launch last week (like we all thought) and end on the 13th. But something happened and they pushed it back a week. They changed the files to indicate the new end date, but forgot to change the box dialogue. (Because the store timer is still counting down 28 days…which is November 19th…)
Hey Howdy Hey Tappers!
Halloween has finally arrived in our pocket-sized Springfields! With Kodos and Kang running the show it’s hard to know if this event will be all tricks…or treats for Tappers!
We’re back to multi-events for this one. So love them, or hate them, they’re still here. So let’s all try to make the best of this…(I’ll have more thoughts in my next musings post…)
Anywho….things kick off with some 6s tasks for Kodos, Kang, and Cthulhu which means…yes, if you don’t have Kodos and Kang you’ll get them at the start of this event. Also, this means, this THOH event is a continuation of the Cthulhu’s Revenge mini-event. Which is kinda cool..at least to me.

After you’ve completed these initial tasks you’ll kick off THOH XXX Week 1…

Hey Howdy Hey Tappers!
While we wait for Halloween to finally hit…we’ve been given the OK to share SOME spoilers with you guys. Info is below, so if you don’t want to know…don’t click below…
If you just want the basics…like when it starts, basic theme ideas, mostly spoiler free…check out this post from yesterday.
UPDATE: The update has hit the server, but it’s still not available in the app store as of yet. Give it about an hour or so, needs to get approval from iOS, Android, and Amazon before it shows up as an update.
