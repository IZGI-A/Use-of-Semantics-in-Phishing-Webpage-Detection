Was looking for a quiet place for some me time and found this perfect spot during lunch on a Wednesday. Ordered the Buddha Bowl from the lunch set menu, and it came with a cup of beef and tomato soup. Presentation was amazing, and ingredients were fresh but I felt so tired trying to get through it. Firstly, the avocado was halved but served with its skin still intact. I had to ask for a side plate to remove its skin and cut the avocado into smaller bite-sized pieces. Secondly, the bright red and yellow peppers were cut into quarters (far from the usual cubes). Similarly, I cut them into smaller pieces on the side plate I asked for. Finally, I gave up when it came to the long strips of cucumber sticks and just ate them separately.
Basically, I felt like I was served a fixed set of fresh ingredients to prepare a DIY salad. The person who prepared this dish has either never eaten a salad or thinks that he‚Äôs serving a rabbit. Considering how it‚Äôs a lunch option, more thought should be put into making it quick and convenient to consume. All in all, it was $20.80+ for the fresh ingredients and laid-back ambience. Might return to try the burgers or sandwiches.
Came to try their duck. Shared their signature whole roasted duck between 2 of us. We were impressed with the flavourful and tenderness of the duck meat! It was so delicious that we finished it easily (we thought we might not be able to finish the whole duck). üëç
The portion is good, not too little and not too much as well. Sauce is yummy, slightly different from others but in a good way.
The only grip I have about it is the use of disposable utensils even for dining in. Other than that all is good. Price is affordable as well
Oh, queue is still going strong at 1330hr!
Loitering at the back of my head for the longest time has been the intention to visit @bebekgorengpakndut_sg. This casual Indonesian eatery is famous for their crispy fried duck and yesterday, I finally found out for myself exactly how good it is.
Each serving comes with a piece of thigh meat with the drumstick attached, plain rice, a small piece each of fried tempeh and tau kwa, blanched kangkong and cabbage, raw sliced cucumber and a small tomato (price: $9.90). The skin of the duck lived up to its reputation as it was astonishingly crispy with hardly any fat beneath. When I saw the meat, I thought it would be dry and stringy but to my surprise, there‚Äòs juiciness in the fibre of the flesh and it was very tasty. I enjoyed every bit immensely, more so with the two available types of chilli sauces (you can help yourself to them as much as you want). Alternating between the savoury bright red (I think it‚Äôs called Sambal Belado) and the sweetish dark brown was what I did because I found them both extremely appetising despite being very spicy.
Now I understand why foodies like @singaporeliciouz @blueskiescottonclouds and @the_xw, have raved about this place.
By the way, I recommend ordering the Kangkong Belachan ($5.90) as well. It is different from the ubiquitous sambal version, that honestly speaking, I am not a fan of.
Price: SGD4.50
Very tasty bowl of soup despite the not so good appearance.
Premium price for roast duck rice but I got to say the on-point and totally not mushy jasmine white rice, shoyu onsen egg and the tender & juicy duck breast meat seal the deal.
Chef‚Äôs flourless chocolate cake is thick, solid, like a dark chocolate bar.
.
The berries cut through the richness from the chocolate cake, while the creaminess from the vanilla ice cream works wonder with the chocolate cake.
