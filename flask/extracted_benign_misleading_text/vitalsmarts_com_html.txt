Leaders are not defined by title or position, rather by their ability to influence others. Our training courses teach leaders to motivate others, improve performance, and transform corporate culture.
Our training teaches skills to speak up honestly and respectfully, enabling teams to extinguish fiery blowups, diminish silence, and foster open dialogue.
One by one we've helped more than two million people develop leadership skills, resolve conflicts, improve relationships, and become more productive.
With training events delivered both in person and online, we help develop leaders at every level.
Our training solutions target the unwritten, deep-seated sources of human behavior to help organizations foster accountability, spur open communication, develop influential leaders, and increase productivity.
The health of any organization, team, or relationship can be measured by the lag between identifying and discussing problems â€” or the accountability gap.
Our Crucial Accountability course provides skills to align expectations and performance, and helps close the gap.
