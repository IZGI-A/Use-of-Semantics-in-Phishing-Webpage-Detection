TextExpander offers an invaluable platform for sharing knowledge within our team. We can use these templates and resources to complement our personal knowledge, enabling us to provide faster and more customized service to our own users, without having to re-write the basic facts or standard data.
TextExpander is a huge productivity boost, especially during our most stressful times. Using the new TextExpander has been an overwhelmingly positive experience. We have been waiting for a way to easily share our snippets amongst the team, and it’s finally here.
TextExpander has been a huge boon for us at AgileBits. We manage a large repository of shared snippets, and TextExpander is the only tool we’ve found capable of handling the job.
I absolutely love TextExpander 6, a definite improvement over version 5. The ability to share snippets with collaborators is priceless in an organization with people around the world using snippets 50+ times a day, we’re now easily able to manage, update, and standardize THOUSANDS of snippets.
Our team is much more efficient, and faster, when using TextExpander. With it, we can serve our customers better by using and updating our shared snippets within our support team. We manage hundreds of shared snippets for customer responses and save many hours of typing. Our team couldn’t live without it.
