Why Teachers Love ALL In
Solving the Data Problem
The ALL In Learning 3-Step Process
- “The All In Learning response system has been a hit with the PLC this year… the data seemed to compile itself.”
- “I literally use the AIL clickers in class every day to gather content mastery data.”
- “We can quickly and easily analyze data and make changes to our instruction… we spend time where they need help not on topics they already understand.”
- “The clickers have transformed the way we do exit tickets in my classroom.”
It’s Like a Fitness Tracker… For Your Classroom!
Fitness trackers let you monitor your activity and diet daily, so you know exactly what to change to reach your goals. ALL In Learning makes it easy for teachers to do the same thing with their students.
