We're happy that Tolstoy has such a nice place to stay when we're away. It's like he has a second family!
Our dogs stayed with Thyrone for a few nights. He sent us lovely photos of our pups having the time of their lives!
With Diana, we couldn't have asked for a lovelier and more professional person to hand our precious furball over to!
Thanks Laura for looking after Jack and keeping us up to date with photos and news while we were away in Spain.
Charlie had the best holiday ever! We were able to enjoy our own holiday knowing he was in Wendy and Tony's safe hands.
We're so glad we found Farah. Lily was immediately happy - especially as she had a doggy playmate for the weekend too!
I had no concerns whatsoever leaving my Border Collie "Ed" with Gemma for our holiday abroad this year.
Frida had a lovely stay by the beach. Rose kept us up to date with photos so we could relax and have a nice time away.
My 18 month old cockapoo had a great stay with Jenny in her lovely home. He's looking forward to many more!
I contacted Nadia as I couldn't leave my dog alone for 12 hours. She was calm, kind and immediately had my trust.
