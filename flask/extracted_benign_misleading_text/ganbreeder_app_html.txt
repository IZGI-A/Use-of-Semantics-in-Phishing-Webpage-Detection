Extend your imagination
Simply keep selecting the most interesting image to discover totally new images. Infinitely new random 'children' are made from each image. Artbreeder turns the simple act of exploration into creativity.
Make images by mixing any Artbreeder images together. Mix a Maltese with a bubble or anything you can imagine.
Any shared image can be used, edited or mixed. Creativity is driven by collaboration and Artbreeder brings this to a new level by being a single place for sharing and creation.
Working on concept art, fashion, jewelry, or something else? Let your discovered images inspire you.
Artbreeder started as an experiment in using breeding and collaboration as methods of exploring high complexity spaces. GAN's are the engine enabling this. Artbreeder is very similar to, and named after, Picbreeder. It is also inspired by an earlier project of mine Facebook Graffiti which demonstrated the creative capacity of crowds. Artbreeder uses these BigGAN models and there is an open source version available.
