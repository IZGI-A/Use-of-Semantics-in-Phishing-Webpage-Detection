Welcome to the Dalyan Olive Lounge, we hope you will find all the information you need on here but if you have any special requests please do not hesitate to contact us.
On board the Olive Lounge there is a full top sun bathing terrace, with optional shade canopy, fully stocked bar, toilet, wash / changing facilities, fresh water shower, swimming floats, snorkeling equipment & *crab fishing equipment (*available on request).
The boat is 13 metres long and can take up to 20 people comfortably - sitting / eating / sunbathing, there is good space for children to play / sleep out of the sun, for sunbathing there is the full length top terrace and area at the front of the boat.
The back of the boat has a platform making getting on / off board very easy, also a ladder going directly into the water, ideal for children and older guests.
Please have a look at our reviews on Trip Advisor which are currently 100% at 5* rating.
We also have our sister boat - The Lemon Lounge, which is to the same high standard. When we have large group bookings / weddings we use the boats together.
We use the Olive Lounge for our private BBQ groups & weddings, the boat is kept very clean & tidy by Captain Ali Yalılı who prides himself on how clean and beautiful his boat is.
