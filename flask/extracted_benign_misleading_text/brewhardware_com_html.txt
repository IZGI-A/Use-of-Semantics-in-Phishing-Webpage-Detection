A lot of our long term online customers express surprise when they find out we sell grain, hops and yeast since we started with hardware 10 years ago. Yup, we do. We also just built a new Grain Bill Builder Page that makes it super easy to find and add exactly the amount of grain you want to the cart without jumping from page to page. Give it a try and let us know what you think!
We've been recommending Auber Instruments products for years and referring tons of business their way without ever making a dime. We finally decided to bring in their most popular single element controllers (The CUBE tabletop economy controller) so you can build an entire electric system and get one big box from us
Did you know that we can drill, punch and otherwise modify pots to your specifications? Whether it's a pot you bring in to the shop or one you purchase from us, we can install any accessory for you. Holes and weldless installs are only $9 per accessory. We can also silver solder in our pull-through bulkhead fittings for $19 per hole/bulkhead. HERMS coil preinstalled? Heating elements preinstalled?
You'll find a random selection of interesting products below but browse around the store to see it all. We have now passed over 1100 unique items.
