I recently got married and needed a marriage registration certificate as we wanted to apply for a passport as a married couple. So we availed MyAdvo’s services, who got our registration done within 30 days. All I had to do was show up once to the magistrate’s office; everything else was taken care of by them. Couldn’t thank them enough for making it hassle-free!
I’m really happy with the service! I had the hardest time with my builder and was really frustrated. I came across the ad on MyAdvo and on our first meeting, they got me in touch with a good property lawyer who helped me with the RERA complaint drafting and legal proceedings of my case. They are professionals of the trade and payment process is both transparent and feasible.
MyAdvo helped me choose a property lawyer who understood the nitty-gritty of my case and spent considerable time to clarify my doubts. The case manager kept me informed about the status of case through Whatsapp and email. Love the pro-activeness of MyAdvo.
I was a victim of a drunk driving accident. We contacted MyAdvo and their case manager discussed the case details and suggested an expert lawyer from Chandigarh. The lawyer handled our case in a professional way by sharing every step of the procedure with us. Great quality service.
