The ZEUS App will help agents win instructions, quickly and efficiently. No need to book to see a property or speak to a vendor, just provide an instant valuation from your mobile device.
On receipt of the property information the agents can provide the user with their valuation and their proposed fees. It works for both residential sales and rentals. They will also have the opportunity to add any extra information that they feel may help them win the instruction such as; ‘I am available to see the property on Friday at 11:00’ or ‘we just sold the flat downstairs last week at £655k’ or ‘we currently have three strong applicants waiting for a flat in this block’.
Agents have to subscribe to use the app. This is done per branch or per online agent. Register your interest
ZEUS will be launching in specific London locations initially. This is to promote controlled and organic growth.
