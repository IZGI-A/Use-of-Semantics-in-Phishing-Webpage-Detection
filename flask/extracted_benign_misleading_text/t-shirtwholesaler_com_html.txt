If you're buying a blank hoodie for home or blank polo shirt for the office, it's unprinted, with nothing on it. If you're buying uniforms for the workplace, it's a billboard for your business after you have them embroidered. If you're buying in bulk for your printing business, it's a canvas for your art. Actually, any way you buy, blank apparel is a blank canvas.

At T-Shirt Wholesaler, we agree that not all apparel is created equal. We carry traditional to trendy pieces at a low cost, but we don't like to use a word like cheap.

And there's nothing low quality about our brands. Let us brag about our brands a little. We're all about the quality of Gildan, the trends of Bella + Canvas, the variety of Next Level Apparel, the durability of Dickies, and the distinction of Harriton, for example. Some other household names we're proud to carry are Comfort Colors, Jerzees, Anvil, econscious, L.A.T. Apparel, Bayside, J. America, Hanes, Fruit of the Loom, Ash City, All Sport, Rabbit Skins, Team 365, and so many more. We also have the latest in Yupoong, Adams, and FlexFit hats, with even more headgear brands you'll recognize. With brands like these, we can stand behind their reputation, so you can purchase with confidence.
If you think blank means basic and boring, our selection will surprise you. Sure, we're here to outfit you in traditional takes, but we're also all about cutting-edge fashion.

For printing and embroidery, there are plenty of options. Check out friendly fabrics like our cotton for a no-nonsense approach to printing or go bold with various popular blends. Clean, crisp embroidery is a breeze with quality apparel and accessories. Look for removable or tearaway tags to make your wholesale t-shirt your own. That's what a tearaway tag is for. You can depend on the quality of your t-shirt, cap, or tote so you can concentrate on the designs of your printing or embroidery. T-Shirt Wholesaler is here to support you and your business.
There are a lot of misconceptions about wholesale. How can T-Shirt Wholesaler offer wholesale t-shirts and other blank apparel at these prices?
