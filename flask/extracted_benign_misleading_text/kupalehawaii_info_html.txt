Training is done in a controlled, safe, slow, environment until you can perform all of the techniques we teach you realistically.
You will learn how to assess, avoid and escape many situations.
You will learn how to settle feelings of fear and panic, use assertive voice control, a parking lot "field trip", and plenty of Self-Defense practice.

The course yesterday was absolutely wonderful, empowering, fun, practical, and more than met my expectations.
Thank you so much for teaching such an amazing course, saving women's lives and being such an advocate for women's safety.
Every woman should take this course, and I will definitely be recommending it to every woman that I know.
I don't think any changes need to be made to the course. It was perfect just the way it is, and I will definitely be signing up for a refresher course.
