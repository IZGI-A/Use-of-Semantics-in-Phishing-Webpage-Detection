Le French GourMay is the one and only major festival in Hong Kong and Macau dedicated to gastronomy à la française, organised under the umbrella of Le French May Arts Festival. French cuisine is one of the few UNESCO-listed culinary cultures in the entire world. Each year, we celebrate this unique culinary treasure in collaboration with one French region.
For the 11th edition in 2019, we will showcase the wonders of a stroll along the LOIRE VALLEY. From 1 to 31 May 2019, Le French GourMay will pair the appetite of the gourmets in Hong Kong and Macau with the historic towns, royal residences, serene landscape from the river to the Atlantic Ocean.
