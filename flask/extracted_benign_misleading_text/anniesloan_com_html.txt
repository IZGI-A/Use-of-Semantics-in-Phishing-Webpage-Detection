Chalk Paint® is the world's best furniture paint. Annie Sloan invented her revolutionary furniture paint, Chalk Paint®, in 1990 and hasn’t stopped refining and improving her formula since.
There's no need for priming or sanding. Chalk Paint® is as easy to use as opening the tin, dipping your brush, and applying paint to furniture!
"Annie Sloan is one of Britain's most influential female designers." - The Telegraph
