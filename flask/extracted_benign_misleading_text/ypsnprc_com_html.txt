Young Professionals in Shipping Network PRC is a social networking organisation which aims to bring together like minded people from the shipping industry. It was founded in Shanghai in 2012 by Natasha Lippens and Fiona Pounds.
Today, YPSN PRC is steered by Wei Zhuang of BIMCO and Tina Liu of Elane-Shipping.
Although not exclusively, as an active association for young shipping peers, YPSN PRC aims to create a platform for shipping professionals at a junior to mid level, the idea being that the connections they make now will remain with them and be of value, as they progress in their respective careers.
YPSN PRC hold sponsored social events on quarterly basis, in a relaxed environment where shipping peers enjoy creating friendships, enhancing knowledge of the business/industry, and developing future business opportunities.
