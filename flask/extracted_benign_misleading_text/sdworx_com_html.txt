We need to be on top of our game. The competition is fierce, and we aim to be in a leading position for the long term – but not out of restless ambition. We see it also as a mission to support a better world, but without being naïve – will not alter the course of the world in sweeping ways. However, we do know employees seek purpose, and companies perform their best when empowered, engaged people drive business forward.
