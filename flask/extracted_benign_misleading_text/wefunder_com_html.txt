There is no secondary market, and it’s hard to price or re-sell your shares. You typically hold on to them for years before a return.
Your dollars help to create and grow companies, not line the pockets of Wall Street. That's often fulfilling.
Many companies have investor perks like VIP access to new products, store credits, or discounts. It’s all part of the experience.
Each company builds its own community, and you're part of it. You can help the companies in your portfolio succeed.
After us, venture capitalists have invested over $2 billion in our portfolio
