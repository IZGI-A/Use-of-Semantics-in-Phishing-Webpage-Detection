I hate this but it seems the time has come. If you follow my wife, you already know a bit of the story of the change in our son, Charlie. We appreciate anything you can do, be it donations, sharing this, or just kind words. Thank you very much. https://www.gofundme.com/...
Hello plurkers! Do you know a game “Stardew Valley”? I quiet enjoy it recently and I finally have my first Void Chicken!(The witch’s voice is quiet scary though.) BTW, I hope that I can keep a meaty instead of a cat or a dog in the game! How cute it will be!
Hello Plurkers, have you ever gone scuba diving? I am considering to have my first try in November in Green Island, a island near Taiwan. Don’t know how it feels like and whether it will worth it or not. (Of course Meaty can’t go with me)
