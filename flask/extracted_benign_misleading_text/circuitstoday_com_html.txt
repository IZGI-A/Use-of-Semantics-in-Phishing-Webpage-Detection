What is Li-Fi Li-Fi is the transmission of wireless data by using visible light as a medium of communication. Also known as Light Fidelity, Li-Fi uses subtle fluctuations in LED light to transmit data from the transmitter to the receiver. To encode the data, the LED light is switched on and off at an imperceptible speed creating slight fluctuations that is invisible to the naked eye. These fluctuations generate binary codes that are transmitted to the receiver which decodes... read more
What is wireless charging? Wireless charging is the process of charging a device wirelessly without the hassle of plugging it into a power socket in the wall, a power bank or another power source.
