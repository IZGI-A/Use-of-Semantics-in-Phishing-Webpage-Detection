Speed Test Flow
When you request a speed test the test data is created randomly. You're not downloading or uploading any real information. This means every TestMy.net speed test is unique, making host caching of the data difficult. When your speed test starts so does a timer, precision of which is measured in ten thousandths of a second. Also, data sizes are precise to the individual byte.
Once the flow of information is finished the timer is stopped and your results are calculated. Test results are calculated first with a simple equation, (size / time) and the resulting number is used to calculate all of your final results. Your result is then compared against your own previous results as well as to other connections in your area, on your host and across the Internet.
