I'm a Christian and part of Kings Church Edinburgh. I try to serve God in all that I do. I'm a husband, and father of two.
I'm a developer (chiefly PHP & Angular), I've built Event Organiser and a number of other plug-ins. You can also find met at WPSE.
In my spare time I enjoy gardening and building stuff with Raspberry Pis, and will happily watch almost any modern history / politics documentary. I have PhD in Mathematics from the University of Edinburgh. My thesis was on Restriction and Isoperimetric inequalities in Harmonic Analysis.
