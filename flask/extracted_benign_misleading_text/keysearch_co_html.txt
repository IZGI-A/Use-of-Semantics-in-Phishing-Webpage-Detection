I've used them all... Long Tail Pro, SEMRush, MOZ, Keyword Planner, Seo Profiler and more but nothing comes close to Keysearch when it comes to keywords. Its a killer tool with amazing features.
It can do way more than just keywords but it really is the ultimate keyword research tool in my book. Not to mention at a bargain price! Support is amazing, with people who really listen. They have even added features I have requested. Love this tool!
