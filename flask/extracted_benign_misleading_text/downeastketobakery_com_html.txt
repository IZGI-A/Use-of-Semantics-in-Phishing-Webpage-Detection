We are a small home based sugar free and keto friendly bakery in Ellsworth Maine. We make our low carb goodies everyday to ensure that every item is as fresh as possible before it arrives at your home.
Everything we make is small batch production. We don't mass produce large quantities of low carb snacks and then store them in a warehouse until they're ordered. Our low carb keto bakery items are prepared and shipped or available for pick up locally. Please allow 3 to 5 business days for order processing.
Please note that we are not medical or nutritional professionals. Nothing we express here should be taken as medical advice and you should consult with your doctor before starting any diet or exercise program. We provide nutritional information for our recipes simply as a courtesy to our customers. We do our best to be as accurate as possible but due to the handmade nature of our products, nutrition information may vary slightly. We expressly disclaim that we will absolve ourselves from any and all liability of any kind with respect to any act or omission wholly or in part in reliance on anything contained in this website
