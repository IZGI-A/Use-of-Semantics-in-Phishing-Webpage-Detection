Astrology, Horoscopes, Numerology
Astrology or Jyotisha is one of the oldest sciences, which takes into consideration the movement of the heavenly bodies and the inter-connection between them. This science is that fine line between uncertainty and enlightenment, mystery and realisation. As Astrology is a Vedanga, it has answers to almost all our problems. Apart from a predictive science, Astrology can also be called an intuitive art. Astrology primarily is of two types: Sayan (Western) and Nirayan (Vedic). Some other types are Chinese, Mayan, Burmese, Tibetan, Hellenistic. Numerology on the other hand deals with numbers and the deeper aspects.
