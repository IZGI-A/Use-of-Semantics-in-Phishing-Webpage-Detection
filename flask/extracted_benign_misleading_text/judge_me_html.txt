Every question that I have had has been answered promptly with direct assistance and a solution. I wish I had installed this app during the launch of my shop, having a very niche business people are constantly on the go and doing reviews is not at the top of their list. Great app and nice format options.
The response time for support is amazing. It doesn't matter what time you write to them, it can be in at 1 AM or 1PM, they resolve your issues almost immediately. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
App was installed on my store very quickly and great customer service. I highly recommend this app.
Just amazing! My store has a custom theme, so the review widget had to be installed manually. I contacted the support and they did it for me in just a few minutes. It looks great, it's easy to use and it's the best review app in my opinion.
The autoinstall option didn't work for me but support got back to me within a few minutes and fixed everything! The reviews look great on my site.
Amazing app and support! They are just great, every time i had a doubt they gave me instant support with real solutions. It's great that it has a free plan and it works like a charm!
I also use them in other stores, and always is fantastic and easy to use! Thanks
