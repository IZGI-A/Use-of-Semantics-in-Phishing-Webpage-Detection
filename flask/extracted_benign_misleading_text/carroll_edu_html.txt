"Carroll College is meant to be a beacon to the Church in the Northwest." — Saint John Paul II
Our academic programs are recognized as being among the very best, because we provide an experiential learning environment that transcends classrooms and labs, leading to the best graduation rate in a five-state region.
Ours is a Catholic liberal arts experience, where we form keen intellects and good hearts, combining reason with faith, rigorous thinking with an awareness of the transcendent. Listen to Fr. Marc describe this through his homilies.
