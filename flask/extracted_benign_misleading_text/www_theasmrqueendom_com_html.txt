ASMR
IS
MEDITATION
WE TAKE THE STRESS OUT OF LEARNING TO MEDITATE!
Over the last decade ASMR has sky rocketed in popularity. Now more than ever people are looking for ways to relax. It's no longer speculation. Now there's actual proof that ASMR puts the brain in the same relaxed state as meditation.
Many people, just simply put, have a short attention span. Let's be real, you're going to ask a person with a short attention span (many millennial's) to "quiet" their thoughts?! Smh.
Thankfully ASMR has close the attention gap allowing a person with the attention span of a squirrel the fair chance to relax their mind by utilizing distinct sounds to encourage proper relaxation focus.
WHAT IS ASMR?
Even Forbes Magazine had to admit in an article in 2018, that ASMR is more than just a tingly trend. Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) has been found to produce relaxing mindfulness reducing stress just as effectively as traditional meditation.
