Beef is a labour of love here at Miller & Carter. We put everything into pursing the perfect steak, from the field to the butcher’s block to the grill, so only the finest, most flavoursome cuts make your plate.
We are proud to have been ‘Awarded Masters of Steak’ from the prestigious Craft Guild of Chefs. Their meticulous inspection of our field to fork practices, from the way we rear our cattle, to how our steaks are butchered, aged and cooked to perfection has led to this industry-leading award. The steps we take with our prime British & Irish beef ensures we deliver our signature ‘steak experience’ on every plate we serve.
