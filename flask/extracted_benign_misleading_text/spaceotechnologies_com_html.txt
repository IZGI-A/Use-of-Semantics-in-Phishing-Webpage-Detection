“Eugene, Vlad, Jigar and their respective teams have been fantastic on all the various apps they have worked on and developed for us over the past 18 months. They are always proactive, responsive to questions and consistently provide top quality development and design work. The use of Skype, email and their own project management tool also makes it easy to keep track on how a project is progressing. I would highly recommend Space-O Technologies for any iOS development or design.”
“I can’t say enough about how great of a partner Space-O has been to work with over the past year. They were always pushing the project forward and ensuring quality checks at every turn, even pieces of my app that I should have caught before sending to development. Will definitely be referring any clients of mine to Space-O and will have them first on my list of partners to work with.”
“The app was successfully launched and fulfilled original expectations. The Space-O Technologies team was communicative and effective in completing the project. The app is available in the Google Play store, and we’re thrilled with the final product. They were a highly efficient team to work with. They were strong communicators—whenever I had an issue they were available. Additionally, they were timely in getting deliverables to us.”
“Space-O Technologies showed genuine interest in the project. The efficient team delivered quality results at a cost-effective price. We wanted to develop a minimum viable product that would be ready for scalability. It was a great experience working with them. We are so happy that we had the chance to meet Space-O. We love their work. Their project management and structure were amazing. The team loved what they were doing. There was passion behind every single piece of work.”
“They performed in all aspects excellently. They have given well-appreciated discounts at various stages of the project and also with suggestions that saved cost. When it comes to delivering, they were always ahead of time. We don’t know how they do that but that’s very impressive. Their agility and customer support is on a different level, well appreciated.”
“The Space-O team were great to work with. Every part of the process went as per the agreed schedule, and the finished prototype met, and in most cases, exceeded my expectations. While Space-O wasn’t the most price competitive of the quotes I received, the quality of their work, professionalism, and product, was well worth the additional cost. Highly recommend, and will continue to use their services for future projects.”
“I hired Space-O to help build my fitness and food log mobile apps. Professional, knowledgeable, and skilled, Space-O delivered a detailed mock app and a fully featured product that launched successfully. The team communicated well and readily grasped concept and intent. Their communication and ability to understand requests were top-notch. I was most impressed with their professionalism, their extensive end-to-end knowledge, and their design capabilities.”
