Just wanted to say a big thank you to Lynda for all her help. We are both seniors, and came in to set up a new checking account. She made certain we understood all the online services and operations. I had online services but had never used them at my previous bank because they were too complicated. She made us feel like friends, and feel confident about choosing WSFS.
