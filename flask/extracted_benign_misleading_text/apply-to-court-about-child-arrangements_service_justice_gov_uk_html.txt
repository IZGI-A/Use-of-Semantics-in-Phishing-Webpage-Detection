Apply to court about child arrangements
You can use this service to apply for a court order about child arrangements. This can be for a child arrangements order, a prohibited steps order, a specific issue order, and a consent order.
The process is different if you're applying in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Fees
The court fee is £215. Only the person applying to court (the applicant) or their solicitor needs to pay. Check if you can get help paying the court fee.
You can pay online (not all courts offer this option) or over the phone using a credit or debit card. You can also send a cheque to the court, or pay in person at the court using cash or cheque.
If you have a solicitor representing you, they may pay the court by direct debit. You’ll need to provide their ‘fee account number’.
Legal aid may be available. Check if you can get legal aid.
