With DeskTime I am able to see how productive my employees are and how much work time they spend on work-related applications - that’s something many other time tracking software don't have.

On The Map Marketing
I'd recommend DeskTime for companies with remote employees or home-office days - time tracking allows people who work remotely feel certain that their work, effort, and dedication won't stay unnoticed.

Founder & CEO at
SmartLab
I was thinking about if there is a solution which can gather me all needed data about team productivity, and at the same time provide more flexible working hours to all team members. I found it possible with DeskTime task and time management system. It is easy to control everything
and I don't need to worry about it working hours anymore.

Support has been on point and incredibly helpful. Excellent customer service. We have made right decision to go with DeskTime.

Better QA
From our perspective, Better QA wants to be a company where people can work from anywhere they want, as long as they do their job. After researching the market for multiple products, DeskTime fits like a glove, at least for us since it does just that. I can easily say that employees are being more productive when working 6 hours a day compared with the regular 9 AM to 5 PM hour job.
