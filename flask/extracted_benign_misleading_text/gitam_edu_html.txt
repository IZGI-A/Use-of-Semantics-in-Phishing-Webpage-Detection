The sprawling green campuses of GITAM were built brick-by-brick and stand as a testimony of our philanthropic visionary, late Dr. Murthi (1938-2018), who has touched many hearts. His belief in the power of education to transform lives, echoes through these walls and reverberates across the far reaches of the globe through our alumni. We miss him dearly and swear to strive to uphold his belief on the power of transformation, student-by-student.
GITAM has established training & placement centre in
each of the institutes headed by a senior faculty member.
