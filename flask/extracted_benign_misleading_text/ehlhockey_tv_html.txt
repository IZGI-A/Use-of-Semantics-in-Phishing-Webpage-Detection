The story behind EHL
With the aim of developing club hockey at an international level, Euro Hockey League (EHL) was introduced for the 2007/08 season, an exciting new format that replaced the menâ€™s European Cup competition.
In Europe, club hockey is at the heart and base of the sport, with players spending 30 to 35 weeks per year training and playing with their clubs. Euro Hockey League sets out to promote and reinforce the status of club level hockey by creating new and more opportunities for the big European clubs to play each other in the international arena and giving club hockey more exposure, more spectators, more high quality TV coverage and a broader media and marketing platform.
This season will see the introduction of EHL Women for the first time next Easter
