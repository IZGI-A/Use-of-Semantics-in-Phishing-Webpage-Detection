Multi-Factor Authentication
New security feature adds an additional layer of security to your data by requiring a Verification Code. The code is entered after you've logged in with your username and password to further verify your identity before granting access to your account. With our customizable multi-tiered module, your organizationâ€™s administrator can easily enable MFA for all users, selected groups or individual users to require an additional form of authentication, using your choice of delivery method, such as SMS Text, Email or Phone Call.
