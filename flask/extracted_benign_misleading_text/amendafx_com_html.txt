Māris ČeičsSecurities accounting specialist at AS "ExpoBank"
I have been a trader working at a bank for many years and have deep knowledge of the services Amenda offers. It is important to me that they're not only licensed in the EU and their activities are under constant monitoring by market regulators, but also that client funds are under protection by an investor compensation scheme. I never imagined it would be possible for a forex broker to provide negative spreads. This is really surprising and only made possible by the fact that they are a genuine NDD broker. Amenda will undoubtedly benefit the P&L of any trader.

I have previously worked as the Latvian representative for Admiral Markets and also worked at Finasta bank for five years in the forex field. As someone with extensive knowledge of the forex business, I can only say that Amenda's service quality in addition to service cost and conditions are without a flaw. I'm really satisfied with Amenda's services. I feel at ease trading with their true DMA and excellent support. I can recommend them with confidence.
Kristaps GintautsAML SPECIALIST AT "BALTIC INTERNATIONAL BANK"
I currently work as a compliance professional with Baltic International Bank, and I feel that Amenda offers impressively well-structured services along with asset protection of customers that is amazingly well thought out. I also trade forex personally and find that many brokers offer spreads that only appear tight and fees that only appear low to attract investors. In fact, many of these brokers intentionally widen spreads during volatile markets and manipulate executions to provide a trading environment that works against investors, but few investors catch on to this reality.
