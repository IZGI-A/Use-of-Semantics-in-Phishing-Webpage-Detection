Consumer engagement is evolving, and today’s audiences seek out experiences that are memorable, modern and personalized while offering the same speed and convenience found online. At Scala, we focus on building strategic partnerships with the world’s leading brands to apply a wide array of technology — including digital signs, mobile sensors, audience intelligence, virtual reality and computer vision technology — in the physical space. We’re transforming how consumers experience retail stores, quick-service restaurants, airports, banks and corporate environments with a “marketing first” point of view, matching the vision with the strategy, experience and delivery capability to make your project a success.
Beyond bringing large-scale, secure digital display networks to market, Scala is adding deep insights into consumer and employee behaviors, patterns and preferences — every digital sign can be a sensor, informing marketing and retail strategy. By analyzing this data, retailers and marketers can personalize and continually optimize in-store screen content, tailoring offers and experiences based on consumer and employee profiles and location.
