We saw this tweet today:
Now is a good opportunity to mention that while SumRando Messenger does provide the ability to link your account with your phone number or email address to make it easier for other users to find you, there is no mandatory link between your SRM account and your phone number or email.
We are committed to providing human rights activists, journalists, LGBTQ, women, and anyone who needs true privacy and anonymity with the tools they need to stay safe and secure.
