Openfire 4.4.2 brings a change that can be leveraged for a new kind of integration with Microsoft Windows.
Traditionally, Openfire ships with its own set of certificate stores. These are the repositories that hold various certificates, which are most commonly used to establish encrypted connections.
As of Openfire 4.4.2, you can now configure Openfire to make use of the certificate stores that are part of / managed by Microsoft Windows. Note that doing this currently allows for Openfire to make modifications to these stores! Some might consider this a bug, while others think it?s a feature.
To configure Openfire to make use of the Windows keystores, define these properties:
xmpp.socket.ssl.trustStoreType value:
Windows-ROOT
xmpp.socket.ssl.identityStoreType value:
Windows-MY
xmpp.socket.ssl.client.trustStoreType value:
Windows-ROOT
xmpp.socket.ssl.client.identityStoreType value:
Windows-MY
As the feature is new, we?d love your feedback and suggestions on this!
The Ignite Realtime Community is happy to announce the promotion of release 4.4.2 of Openfire. This release signifies our effort to stablize a 4.4 branch of Openfire while work continues on the next feature release. A changelog exists denoting the 22 Jira issues resolved since the 4.4.1 release. This release should better support server to server (s2s) connections, fix a few admin console XSS-style issues, and improve client session stability.
