“Parkinson's patients are the experts on what we have. We have a responsibility as patients to share our experience — what works for us, what we respond to, what we can contribute to research.”
— Michael J. Fox
“Participating in research changes how you view your diagnosis… and the world around you. It makes you feel like you are playing an important role in solving a problem that affects millions of people.”— Dan Kinel, Rochester, NY
