The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a nonprofit with a worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom. We defend the rights of all software users. Read more.

Calling all activists, hackers, legal professionals, developers, policymakers, and more: it's time to submit your proposal for talks and workshops at the LibrePlanet 2020 conference! Submissions will be accepted through Nov. 20. Learn more!
Free software developers guarantee everyone equal rights to their programs; any user can study the source code, modify it, and share the program. By contrast, most software carries fine print that denies users these basic rights, leaving them susceptible to the whims of its owners and vulnerable to surveillance.
- The FSF provides critical infrastructure and funding for the GNU Project, the foundation of the popular GNU/Linux family of free operating systems and the keystone of the Internet.
- Our Campaigns Team creates educational materials about free software, convenes the yearly LibrePlanet conference and goes toe to toe against powerful interests that threaten computer user rights.
- Our Licensing & Compliance Lab defends freely licensed software from proprietary hoarding, advises on licensing issues, and certifies devices that Respect Your Freedom.
With your support, we've done these things for more than 30 years. Help sustain us for many more; please become a member today.

"I’ve spent a third of my life building software based on Stallman’s four freedoms, and I’ve been astonished by the results. WordPress wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for those freedoms, and it couldn’t have evolved the way it has." - Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress
