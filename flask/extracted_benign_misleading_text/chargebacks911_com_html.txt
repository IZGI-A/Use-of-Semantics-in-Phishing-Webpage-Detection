Experts at Chargebacks911 explained: “By working out a plan of action in advance, merchants can reduce the risk of chargebacks happening in the first place. But when they do occur, decisive steps are key.”
“Friendly fraud follows surges of increased spending,” a representative from Chargebacks911 said. “Online shopping is growing, and so is friendly fraud.”
“Not fighting back is sending the wrong message to consumers and card companies,” an expert from Chargebacks911 explained. “Letting the dispute go tells them that this is a sure way to get a no-questions-asked refund.”
“Chargebacks are generally thought of as a last resort. There’s a reason for that, say experts at Chargebacks911. “Filing a chargeback without proper justification is a practice known within the industry as friendly fraud.”
“Millennials look for banks who are willing to embrace the idea of organic and seamless functionality,” a representative from Chargebacks911 says. “Financial institutions that capitalize on those desires will be most successful with the Millennial market.”
Credit card companies make it easy to dispute a charge—usually you just log into the issuer’s website and click the dispute button next to the purchase amount, a representative from Chargebacks911 pointed out.
Chargebacks911 is a company that works with some of the largest retailers in the country to challenge illegitimate chargebacks.
“What differentiates Chargebacks911 from the competition? Of course, our technology. And we had a massive head start. Today there are probably 20 competitors, but we were the first. Most importantly, we built a solution based on firsthand experience.”
If customers can't recognize your business's name on their credit card statement, they're more likely to challenge the payment, says Chargebacks911. Check with your card processor to make sure you're registered under an obvious name.
While chargebacks are a means for consumers to fight back against fraudulent transactions, they also produce another result. “They created a new problem…the option to utilize an alternative refund method,” says a representative from Chargebacks911.
