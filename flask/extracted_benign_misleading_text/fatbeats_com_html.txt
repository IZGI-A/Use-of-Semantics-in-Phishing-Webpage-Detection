Happy Born day DeShaun Dupree Holton, aka P, Big Proof, Proof or Derty Harry. Down with D12 he was featured on 1997: The Underground EP, 2001: Devil's Night and 2004: D12 World. His solo LPs were 2002: Electric Coolaid Acid Testing EP, 2004: I Miss the Hip Hop Shop & 2005: Searching for Jerry Garcia. Proof was represented in two ways in 8 Mile, the 2002 biopic based on Eminem's life. He played the MC that causes 'Rabbit' (Eminem) to choke in the first battle-rap scene of the film. But his true spirit inspired the dreadlocked character 'Future' (played by Mekhi Phifer), the MC who organized and refereed the rap battles. May he rest in peace. #d12 #proof #ripproof #ripbigproof
