'hattrick youthclub' is a browser-based tool for managing your youth academy and it provides support for analyzing the data. You can manage all current and former youth players, all league and friendly matches including the player ratings and coach comments.
But there's more to it than that. Scout and coach comments are clearly laid out and all current and potential skill levels of your players are listed. You can see at a glance if a player has reached his maximum skill level or how far he's away from it.
Do you want to know which position is best for a certain player or if a player fits your training concept at the senior team? Do you want to see all known skill levels for a specific skill of all your current players at a glance or analyse the player skills based on the training notes within a second? Then the skill analyzer provides all the support you need and it is improving day by day because our player data pool is growing steadily.
But that's not all: Furthermore 'hattrick youthclub' offers many useful features like showing you if or when you could promote a player to your senior team and you'll be reminded if a player will reach the age of 19 shortly or has already reached it.
A profit and loss statement of your youth academy shows you quickly how profitable your academy is. Additionally you'll discover a lot of tiny useful features which improve the manageability of your youth academy.
We're working continuously on the improvement of this tool. It's worth to take a look at the news regularly to stay up to date.
Hattrick Youthclub is CHPP licenced and all available CHPP services are implemented!
