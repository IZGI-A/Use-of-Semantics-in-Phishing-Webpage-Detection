What do we do?
With over 10 years of experience in the industry, All the Anime was founded around three key goals:
1
CONTENT
We curate and pick up creatively interesting films & TV series.
Be it a hot well-known work or a hidden gem, we strive to deliver cool releases on Blu-Ray and DVD.
2
CINEMA
We want you to have a chance to see it as it was intended!
Our films screen in festivals, cinemas and communities - contact us if you'd like to organise a screening!
3
DIGITAL
We try to make content accessible legally online as widely as possible.
You'll find our titles on Netflix, Viewster, Animax, Wakanim and more!
