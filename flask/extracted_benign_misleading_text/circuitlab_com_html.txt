from the CircuitLab Community
Easy-wire mode lets you connect elements with fewer clicks and less frustration.
Cross-window copy/paste lets you easily explore and re-mix parts of public circuits from the CircuitLab community.
Mixed-mode circuit simulation lets you simulate analog and digital components side-by-side.
SPICE-like component models give you accurate results for nonlinear circuit effects.
Human-friendly formats let you enter and display values concisely, just like you would on a paper schematic.
Unit-aware expression evaluation lets you plot arbitrary signals of interest, such as differential signals or power dissipation.
In-browser simulation and plotting lets you design and analyze faster, making sure your circuit works before ever picking up a soldering iron.
Unique circuit URLs let you easily share your work or ask for help online.
“Give it a try – this is a great idea.”
“Amazingly user friendly and simple for even the novice hobbyist to dive into.”
“Browser-based circuit simulator boasts a mountain of features.”
“ CircuitLab is the best editor I have ever used. Bug-free design, excellent simulation. Well done. No more using LTSpice. ”
“ In our product development cycle, we've used CircuitLab in more places than you might expect: optimizing our analog front-end, RF matching network analysis, improving our power supply robustness, and designing and documenting test and production fixtures. ”
