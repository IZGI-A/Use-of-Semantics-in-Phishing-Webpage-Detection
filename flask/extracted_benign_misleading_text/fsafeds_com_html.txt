It's your choice which payment or reimbursement option to use.
A Health Care FSA (HCFSA) is a pre-tax benefit account that's used to pay for eligible medical, dental, and vision care expenses that are not covered by your health care plan or elsewhere. With an HCFSA, you use pre-tax dollars to pay for qualified out-of-pocket health care expenses.
Our calculators will help you estimate your Flexible Spending Account contributions and potential annual savings. Your tax savings are based on marginal federal/state rates and FICA.
