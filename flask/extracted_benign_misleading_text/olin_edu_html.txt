Entrepreneurship at Olin
At Olin we have an expansive view of entrepreneurship (E!). Throughout the curriculum we connect the teaching of engineering to entrepreneurship by encouraging our students to put humans and their needs at the forefront of everything they do. Watch our new E! video today.
Our entrepreneurship stream offers students a structured experience to help them develop the mindset, the methods and the resources needed to act on their entrepreneurial ideas and interests.
Products & Markets is Olin’s introductory entrepreneurship class and is taken by every student in the second semester of their first year. In small, dynamic teams, students explore their entrepreneurial curiosity.
