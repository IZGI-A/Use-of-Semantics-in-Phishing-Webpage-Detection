INTERPRET YOUR OWN HOROSCOPE
Pam Tyler M.Div, J.D., Dip.API

There is no previous knowledge needed just a willingness to see your circle of possibility in wide eyed amazement at the insight astrology gives you for every-day living. Gather with veteran astrologer Pam Tyler for a fun, instructive workshop designed to teach absolute beginner the basics without the aggravation of complicated mathematics and jargon.
