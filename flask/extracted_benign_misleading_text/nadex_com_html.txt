Three ways to trade.
Nadex Binary Options turn every trade into a simple question: will this market be above this price at this time.
A Nadex Touch Bracket has floor and ceiling "knockout" points. This structure can maximize effective leverage and provide natural profit targets.
Nadex Call Spreads have a floor-to-ceiling trading range which offers defined risk without the need for stops, allowing time for the market to prove you right.
