After attaining great success in the field of recruitment and assessments, owing to prevalent market conditions, we at Conifer Services underwent a drastic diversification under the leadership of our director Mr. Ashok Pratap Rai.
Mr. Ashok Pratap Rai, with his 30 years of corporate & government experience, had to been worried about the bad environmental conditions in the country along with recent news of many fires breaking out in populous places, since a long time. As a response to both these problems that continue to plague the nation, he identified two fields of Bio-medical Waste Management & Firefighting. It is a testament to his exemplary vision that soon after Conifer Services expanded into these fields, many new government laws have been made on the same lines (Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 & National Building Code 2016).
Conifer Services Private Limited has gained immense success in a very short time and our large client base & increase in annual turnover are testament of this fact.
