Choose your legend
The Hammer
Feel the sound of drums as you run towards the gates of your enemies. Laugh at their terrified faces and their tiny defenses. The horns get blown â€“ a wasted effort. You will be gone with the goods before their friends mount their horses. But raids aren't enough. Your army will grow, and so will your hunger for more. You are free. Free to conquer every corner of this world until all kneel in your presence.
Harder than Steel
Wars aren't won in a day. Let all the fools run around bashing each other while you establish a thriving economy. You will be standing on top of fortified walls, mocking countless armies losing their spirit. Outsmart your opponents on every move they make. Lay traps for their troops and hold the prisoners ransom. Cooperate with your neighbors, form the backbone of your alliance and become a true protector of the people.
Lead with Greatness
Alexander. Caesar. You. Some leaders shape entire eras of history. Rise up to turn your alliance from a horde of warriors into an uncontested force. A true leader doesn't sit in his castle waiting for the right moment. Use your charisma and diplomatic guile to sustain power, manipulate your rivals and hold your empire together forever. Don't just be part of the story. Tell it. This era is yours.
