A Fantastic ResourceCraig Massey, White Pixels
"The content is great as an introduction and for more detail in some areas (such as Photoshop etc). The downloadable PDFs are also excellent – print them or keep them on your tablet device for quick reference out in the field. As an aspiring Pro it’s a fantastic resource with good articles and hopefully much more to come."
