We are specialist electronic designers working for clients both big and small. We provide anything from simple electronic designer services to complete electronic product design, with our quality of service and wide ranging experience placing us as a leader in this specialist field.
Finding a good electronics designer to carry out design for a new development project can be daunting. Our clients range from companies and individuals who use us as their complete engineering department to those who use us on demand as needed. Many of our clients come from non technical industries and we are equally at home working for companies and individuals with no electronic knowledge as those based in high technology industries. We deliberately remain a small company, keeping our running costs low and so we are able to provide our clients with a high quality personal service.
