* Do you know what the Round-Robin DNS is?
Suggested article from our blog: What is Round-Robin DNS and how to set it up?
Round-Robin DNS meaning:
Round Robin DNS is a technique of load distribution, load balancing, or fault-tolerance. It provisions multiple Internet Protocol service hosts, by managing the Domain Name System's responses to address requests from client computers. For this action, Round Robin DNS uses a statistical model.
Here you can find Round-Robin example configuration!
How does it work?
Most often, Round-Robin DNS is used to load balance requests between several Web servers. Imagine that you have one domain name and four identical copies of the same website, residing on four servers with four different IP addresses. When one user tries to access your website it will be sent to the first IP address. The second user will be sent to the next IP address etc.
