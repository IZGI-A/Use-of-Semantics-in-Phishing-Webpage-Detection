Artists love MeldaProduction plugins!
Rabbit in the Moon
If someone told me we could only use plugins from one company to mix, master and effect with for the rest of our days, we'd chose Melaproduction. The depth of sound and programmability is astounding.

Since I have first discovered Melda plugins they've become an essential part of my productions. They are the perfect blend of engineering and creativity.
