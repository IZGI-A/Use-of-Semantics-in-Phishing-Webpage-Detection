Principal's Message
Greetings from the Principal, Lady Shri Ram College for Women (LSR), a premier educational institution of the University of Delhi.
LSR was established in 1956 by late Sir Shri Ram in memory of his wife. His commitment to the cause of education was not merely philanthropic but was integral to his idea of nation building. Today, LSR has evolved into a gateway to excellence. We not only prove ourselves in academics but also in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. A look at the many university rank holders across departments as well as the number of awards won at national and international sports and cultural competitions, the numerous distinguished visitors as well as the multitude of societies that college is buzzing with bears testimony to the rich tapestry that characterises LSR.
