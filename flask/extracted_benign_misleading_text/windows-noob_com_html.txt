huge problem with mbr2gpt
By Atomic12,
Hi, I am having big problems with the implementation of a mbr2gpt step in an win7 to win10 upgrade TS. We want to update our Windows 7 machines, mainly Dell Precision 5810 and 5820 to windows 10 1903, and so far I have managed to succesfully implement every step that we need (well almost) but this mbr2gpt simply fails. I have a tread open on technet forums with all the infos: https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/cdadd583-0853-4b34-a073-2e87fd950acf/mbr2gpt-cannot-find-os-partit

If I run the Command C:\Windows\CCM>SCToastNotification.exe “Hello” “Dummy”, it is disp
Moving from Server 2008 R2 and SCCM 2012 R2
By MagnumVP,
My system currently sits at SCCM 2012 R2 SP1 CU4 on Server 2008 R2. If I want to move to SCCM CB 1903 would it be best to; Upgrade the existing SCCM from 2012 to CB and then migrate to a new server (2008 R2 to 2016)? Add a 1903 CB to the environment and then swing migrate from 2012 to CB (if this is even possible??) Also if anyone can answer this (Googled and Bing....without success). Within out EA agreement I can download System Center Standard/Datacenter 2019. How does t
