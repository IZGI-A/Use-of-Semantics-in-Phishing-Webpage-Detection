Before using this patch, make sure you have fully removed any other “RAM patches” you may have used. This patch does NOT enable test signing mode and does NOT add any watermarks.
Note: I do not offer any support for this. If this did not work for you, either:
- You cannot follow instructions correctly, or
- You cannot use more than 4GB of physical memory on 32-bit Windows due to hardware/software conflicts. See the comments on this page for more information.
