The Rules
The first rule of clean plate club is we don’t talk about clean plate club.
The second rule of clean plate club is, actually, we can talk about clean plate club as much as we want; what we really meant is that we don’t talk during clean plate club, because we’re too busy eating, and you shouldn’t talk with your mouth full.
The third rule of clean plate club is, then again, maybe actually don’t talk about clean plate club, because talking about a club that’s just a bunch of people sitting around eating does not the best conversation make. We’re just trying to help you out here, socially.
The fourth rule of clean plate club is that if you drop something off your plate, you may retrieve it and eat it as long as said retrieval occurs within 5 seconds of the drop. Even if you miss out on the timing, though, don’t just leave it there. It may be called clean plate club, but it’s really clean plate and clean floor club, people! C’mon!
The fifth rule of clean plate club is that ‘clean plate’ is obviously a bit of an exaggeration. There might be some bones, or some scraps, or some sauce left over. You don’t have to actually, like, lick all that stuff up.
The sixth rule of clean plate club is, hey, if the sauce is really good, though, maybe do lick it up? Like, damn, why waste good sauce, right?
The seventh rule of clean plate club is definitely don’t eat the bones. That would be bad.
The eighth rule of clean plate club is, please, clean your plate after eating.
The Rules of Edible Engagement by MJ
Here’s a theory: MJ goes by MJ because she’s simply got too much going on to be writing out her full name every single time she needs to sign off on something. Like, sure, at one point she went as geekfactor12 and designed a bunch of awesome shirts for Shirt.Woot. But now? Now that she runs Tee Magnet? And Compete-tee-tion? How could she possibly have time to write out her whole name at the end of every email, or in the username field of every site she belongs to? Which is not meant to be a judgement. If anything, we’re inspired by her level of productivity. And so, we’re proud to announce, our site will now refer to itself simply as M. (Okay, fine, not really.)
