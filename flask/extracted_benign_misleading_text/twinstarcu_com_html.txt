Classroom Cash
Each year TwinStar Credit Union awards grants to a variety of educators throughout our service area
Applications available September 3
In 2018, 271 teachers received Classroom Cash. Classroom Cash awards were distributed to each county in TwinStar Credit Union’s service area - from Tacoma to Portland. Teachers used grant funds for all types of classroom enhancements from calculators, software, books, musical instruments, educational toys and games, and more! Some teachers use the award to arrange field trips for students that would not have occurred without Classroom Cash.
