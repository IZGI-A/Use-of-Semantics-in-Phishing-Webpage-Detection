Micro Switch, a division of Honeywell, has some of the most iconic keyboards of all time. The Symbolics "Space-Cadet" keyboard is immediately recognizable, but the Honeywell Terminal Keyboard with its Red/Grey/Black/White colorway is just as visually striking. Not only is the set gorgeous, the Hall Effect switches are often regarded as some of the finest switches ever manufactured.
The colors of the Honeywell Terminal Keyboard are so simple and classic that they deserve to join the ranks of classic sets. We are very excited to announce that we have translated the colorway into a GMK keycap set.
The set is in collaboration with livingspeedbump from keychatter.
The set is newly manufactured by GMK in Germany with the original Cherry equipment. GMK is known for using high quality materials to ensure longevity in its products.
This is created with Cherry’s original double-shot molding equipment using the highest quality ABS plastic.

A spicy yet refreshing take on a black base keycap set. Wasabi uses elements of 9009 and Originative to create a subtle ambiance. Sour, the creator of Wasabi, decided to use Japanese sub-legends to go with the set.
Sour decided to strip the set with as many keys as possible to offer the set at a lower introductory price.

The original Miami keyset was first run in 2013 and has since spawned many variants. We are delighted to introduce Miami in a new profile, while taking advantage of the striking colors offered by GMK to fulfill our Miami Dreams.

A set inspired by Dave2D. Dave and Cyan are like a match made in heaven. He brings a grey tone into his logo which helped us in turn design a set similarly to that idea. We wanted to add neutral tones to our infamous Cyan set which gives us a Honeywell like yet bringing the vibrancy from Cyan.

With a dark black font legend on a creamy beige color, this classic style was a popular color combination for Cherry Corp's mechanical keyboards from 1986 to 2009. We added three extra options to your liking of color. These are brand new, made with original BSP equipment, this set is perfect for keyboard enthusiasts who prefer an unassuming but classy setup for their mechanical keyboards.
This keyset is made for winkeyless-style keyboards. Most of these keyboards have winkey blockers. This keyset is an exception as it carries 1x Window keys to replace those blockers if necessary. Numberpad kit (tenkeypad) will not be included.
Note: Set will come with GMK L9 spacebars (6.25u and 7u). This set only covers a tenkeyless and winkeyless layout. All keys included are pictured.
