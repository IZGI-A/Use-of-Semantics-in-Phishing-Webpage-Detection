An incredibly utilized workhorse of a helicopter, the CH-53E is capable of carrying a 26,000-pound light armored vehicle, and 16 tons of cargo or personnel 50 miles and back to lead assault or humanitarian missions. First used by the U.S. Navy in the late 1980s, the CH-53E is the U.S. Marines variant and has proven to be one of the most reliable assets in the history of Marine Aviation. Its most common use is as assault transport of Marine ground forces, but the Super Stallion is no stranger to long-range resupplies of covert Marines either.
