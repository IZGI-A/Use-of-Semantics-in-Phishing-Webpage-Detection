Our Story
Come on by the one place in Clark, Colorado where the fun never ends!
With year-round activities and lodging, there is never an excuse not to join the Roadhouse family!
Along with our activities we have a full restaurant and bar that is open 7 days a week, gas and diesel station and a fully stocked convenience store, with all the goodies you may have forgotten behind.
We pride ourselves in being a family owned business and always open our arms to those who want to join. The community of Hahnâ€™s Peak and the Zamzow family welcome you to the Hahn's Peak Roadhouse!
