Moderation Tools
Kidblog provides K-12 teachers with tools to safely publish student writing. Teachers can monitor all activity within a community of authors. Posts can even be public, but nothing goes live until a teacher approves it.

Kidblog empowers students to write with a meaningful purpose for a real audience. Connect with other classes down the hallway, across your district, or around the world. Students practice digital citizenship within a secure environment.
Digital Portfolios
Kidblog enables schools to document student learning over time. With no manual curation required, students' portfolios are built automatically across classes, demonstrating growth year-over-year. Parents can celebrate their children's achievements throughout their academic journey.
