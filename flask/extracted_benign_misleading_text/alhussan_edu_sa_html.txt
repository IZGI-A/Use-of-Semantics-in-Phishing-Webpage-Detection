Alhussan group for Education and Training Holding has obtained the International accreditation certificate from AdvancED after a visit from the organization and performance evaluation.
Mr. Rashid Alhussan, President of alhussan Group for Education and Training Holding said: Educational institutions in different countries of the world have become required to obtain some kind of recognition and accreditation and to protect the degree they give to their students and to treat them on an equal footing with other countries in the world.
"The primary objective of the accreditation is to reassure the public that the educational institution and its outputs are competent and skilled in achieving their aspirations and aspirations to obtain highly qualified human resources to successfully practice the profession, as well as to enhance the confidence granted to all certificates given to its members, With the credibility of that educational institution.
Mr. Rashid pointed out that alhussan schools' access to institutional accreditation from AdvancED is of great importance because this accreditation granted alhussan group as a whole and did not give a school in its own right. This is a precedent in the Kingdom. Any alhussan education project will be directly accredited by AdvancED
Mr. Rashid thanked the AdvancED team and stressed the keenness of alhussan schools to keep abreast of the latest educational techniques and to apply the best educational theories and strategies to reflect the student's performance.
He also thanked all school staff in various fields of education, administration, education, training and support services.
AdvancED is the largest educational community in the world, serving more than 30,000 public and private schools and an area across the United States and in more than 70 countries that educate more than 16 million students.
