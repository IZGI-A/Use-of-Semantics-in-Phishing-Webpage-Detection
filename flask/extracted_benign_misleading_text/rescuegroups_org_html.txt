Save Time with the Pet Adoption Portal,
Data Management Service, Website Service, and more services designed for Animal Welfare Organizations
Exports to Hundreds of Adoption Websites and Services - Free!
When you post your adoptable pets with us, we can send them out to over 200 pet adoption listing websites. You have full control of where your pets appear, and it's all done for free.
We are a Non-Profit
That means that our one-and-only mission is to help the community and no one is profiting personally from what we are doing. You won't find any ulterior motives in what we do.
Over 6,200 Partner Organizations
We receive many testimonials from organizations who want to let others know of their great experiences using RescueGroups.org services.
Secure, Web-based Services
We take security very seriously. Our data management website uses SSL to protect your account information, and we require every user to have their own user name and password.
Most volunteers don't have time to update more than one or two websites. Our online animal management software tools such as the Pet Adoption Portal, Data Management Service, and Website Service can automatically send your animal data and pictures to a long list of websites. You update only one pet list, and the other websites get updated!
Pet Adoption Portal
The Pet Adoption Portal is completely free animal shelter management software and includes free uploads to a long list of animal adoption listing websites like Petfinder, Facebook, DogTime.com, PetBond.com, Adopt-a-Pet.com, and the ASPCA. Risk Free, No Contracts, Unlimited Users, Unlimited Storage
