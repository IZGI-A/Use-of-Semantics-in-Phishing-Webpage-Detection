So often getting dressed is treated as an outcome, not a variable. The “look” is the result, rather than a tool for facilitating more important results. Results like your work, your day, your relationships, your mood. And I get it - clothing might seem frivolous on the surface. The word "fashion" even has a plasticky, insincere feel to me. But the truth is, we wear clothes every day of our lives. Every single day. You wake up, and you choose something to put on your body. The fabric touches your skin all day. Articles of clothing are arguably the most personal and intimate possessions you own. Your conscious clothing choices tell your subconscious self something about how you feel, what you think, how you’re choosing to arm yourself for the day. Clothing can facilitate or hinder your work, and clothing can be a tool or a crutch. Your clothing determines the first impression you give others. It speaks about you before you have a chance to say any words. You can create or deny an identity with what you wear.
