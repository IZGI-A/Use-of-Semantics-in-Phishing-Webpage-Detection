|DOSBox 0.74-3 has been released!
A security release for DOSBox 0.74:
- Fixed that a very long line inside a bat file would overflow the parsing buffer. (CVE-2019-7165 by Alexandre Bartel)
- Added a basic permission system so that a program running inside DOSBox can't access the contents of /proc (e.g. /proc/self/mem) when / or /proc were (to be) mounted. (CVE-2019-12594 by Alexandre Bartel)
- Several other fixes for out of bounds access and buffer overflows.
- Some fixes to the OpenGL rendering.
The game compatibility should be identical to 0.74 and 0.74-2.
It's recommended to use config -securemode when dealing with untrusted files.
Ideally, 0.75 should have been released by now, but some bugs took a lot longer than expected.

|DOSBox 0.74-2 has been released!
A maintenance release for DOSBox 0.74, which solves the following problems:
- Windows: Fix auto/max cycles algorithm on Windows 7, which helps with stuttering audio.
- Mac OS X: Bring a 64 bit version and improve performance.
- Linux: Fix the 64bit dynrec cpu core and a lot of compilation problems. Add patches for the WINE Team.
The game compatibility should be identical to 0.74.
We have saved all game fixes for the upcoming 0.75 release, which will enter regression testing soon. This release has been created so you can go back to 0.74-2, in case we happen to break your favourite game in 0.75.
