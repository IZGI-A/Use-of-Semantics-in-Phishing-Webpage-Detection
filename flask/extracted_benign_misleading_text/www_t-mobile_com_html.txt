There’s never been a better time to join the Un-carrier! You’ll grow. Innovate. And change the world for good. Join us to be bold–and #BEYOU.
As we continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on communities across the country, we are still looking for the best talent to #BeMagenta and grow their careers with us, though response times may be delayed as we navigate the changes. Note that while many roles are currently being performed in a work-from-home capacity, we will resume onsite work when it is safe to do so.
Don’t miss out on your chance to #BeMagenta, #BePowerful and #BEYOU! Our Un-carrier Jobs Initiative commits to hire 5,000 new employees over the next year. Join our T-Mobile Talent Community to learn more!
#TeamMagenta is 50,000+ unique individuals united in our obsession for delivering great customer experiences, solving pain points, and challenging the status quo—at work and in life.
We don't have a corporate ladder – it's more like a jungle gym of options. Your careers path may take you in directions you didn't think were possible.
Our culture of shared success comes from an unrelenting focus on people – customers AND employees. Your first responsibility: be yourself.
Medical, dental, and vision are just the start. We also offer health pro consultants, flexible spending accounts, and more—even for part-time employees!
Kick back with paid time off. We want you to have flexibility, convenience, and control over how you recharge.
We fully foot the tuition bill at five online universities (FT only), and provide tuition assistance to other schools for both FT and PT employees.
Naturally, we offer steep discounts on our consumer rate plans and all the fantastic accessories we carry. We also hook you up with discount programs for everyday stuff.
Families rock. But childcare, adoption, and surrogacy are big decisions. We offer financial and wellness support to help reduce those burdens and navigate the details.
Options include a 401(k) plan, an annual Employee Stock Grant, and a purchase plan that gives you the chance to grab TMUS stock at a discount.
