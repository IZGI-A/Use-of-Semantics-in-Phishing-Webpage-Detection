iNaturalist.org is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society.
Record your observations
Discuss your findings
Every observation can contribute to biodiversity science, from the rarest butterfly to the most common backyard weed. We share your findings with scientific data repositories like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to help scientists find and use your data. All you have to do is observe.
Record your encounters with other organisms and maintain life lists, all in the cloud.
Help scientists and resource managers understand when and where organisms occur.
Connect with experts who can identify the organisms you observe.
Find a project with a mission that interests you, or start your own.
Build your knowledge by talking with other naturalists and helping others.
Hold an event where people try to find as many species as possible.
I use iNaturalist to share information with other people who are interested in Madagascan plants. It is also an opportunity for me to validate the photos and information recorded during field trips, and to provide information on species distribution for the IUCN Red List assessments.Hélène Ralimanana
No matter where in the world you are, iNaturalist brings people together. Whether you have a PhD or just love the outdoors, iNaturalist will bring you closer to nature and many fellow naturalists. Viva Naturalista!!Carlos G. Velazco Macias
As a child I was constantly outside searching for bugs and other creatures. Unfortunately that need to explore faded away as I became older. Now that I’ve been hiking more often, iNat has helped bring back that side of myself. I don’t just look at a plant and see a plant. I get close enough to see what could be crawling on that plant, and I want to know everything about it.Danielle Doyle
