* Do you know what the FQDN is?
Suggested article from our blog: What is FQDN? What does FQDN do?
FQDN is:
Fully Qualified Domain Name. In contrast to the Partially Qualified Domain Name (PQDN) which has 2 elements – TLD (Top Level Domain) and domain name, the FQDN has one more – hostname. It is used to show the absolute location in the DNS hierarchy.
Example of FQDN:
Taking the case of www.reddit.com, we have the .com TLD, the domain name reddit, and the hostname www.
If you want to check the FQDN, you can do a lookup. Just check this link here, and you can find how to perform the lookup on different OSes.
