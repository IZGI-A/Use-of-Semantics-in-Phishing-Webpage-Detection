We offer a wide range of courses, from undergraduate and postgraduate degrees to short courses and professional qualifications, many of which are available to study full-time or part-time to best suit your needs and lifestyle.
Dedicated to employability
We take pride in helping our students reach their goals and succeed in their careers. 96.7% of all London Met graduates are in work or further study within six months (Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education survey 2016â€“17). All of our undergraduate courses include some form of work-related learning, such as a placement, client project or on-campus work experience, and many courses are accredited by professional bodies.
