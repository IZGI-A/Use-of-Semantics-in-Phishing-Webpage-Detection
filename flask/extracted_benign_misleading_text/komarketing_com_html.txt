Case Study
John Deere Machine Finder
When KoMarketing started working with John Deere in 2003 (they continue to be a client), the company’s website, machinefinder.com, had virtually no search engine optimization, and extremely dated site technology. Challenges included:
- Poor optimization overall, including lack of optimized foreign language content
- Non-indexing of pages including foreign language URLs
- Lack of backlinks pointing back to the website
Results: The initial optimization quadrupled the search engine traffic to the site, with dealers seeing a pronounced improvement in direct inquiries for equipment.
