How it works
This is what happens when a person wants a t-shirt
Your store
Connect your online store to Printful and fill it with products covered in your designs. A customer then orders one of the shirts sold on your store.
Printful factory
That order is automatically sent to Printful where it gets printed, packed and shipped. You get a notification and tracking number when the order is shipped.
Your client
Your customer receives their order in a package covered with your brand, which makes it look like you shipped it out yourself!

Store your entire inventory in our warehouse, and we'll fulfill all your orders for you.
