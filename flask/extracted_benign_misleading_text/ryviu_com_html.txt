Ryviu is the best app created when it comes to adding reviews from Aliexpress & Amazon.
It has full integration with Importify & Zonify and a very simple process to import product reviews.
I ran a few Facebook Ads with no results.
I researched and found that I needed social proof, and, being a new store, I didnâ€™t have any reviews yet.
I found this app, imported reviews and made my first sale immediately after running my next Facebook ad. I can say confidently that this app was the deciding factor on my sales.

They have the life-time subscription and it is the most affordable one so far.

Our apps have worked wonderful for us, nicely built, and support, very understanding and helpful.
Thanks for everything. Best wishes!
Being completely honest.
Because I am a business guy rather than a tech guy I have had more than a few difficulties with this app and have not got the full use out of it.
However I decided to give this one last try I have to say that the help and customer service I received from both Yen and then Tuyen was fantastic.
Now my reviews are up to date and the layout on my shopify store looks great!
This plugin is amazing, and saves so much time.
Easy install instructions and great support from the programmer.
Wish all plugins were this good!
