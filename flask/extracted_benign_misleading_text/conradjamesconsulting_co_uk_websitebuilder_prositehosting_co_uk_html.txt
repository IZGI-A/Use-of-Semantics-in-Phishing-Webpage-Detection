Conrad James Consulting is a Colchester based consultancy offering nationwide business planning and coaching to individuals wanting to start a business and consultancy to existing businesses of all sizes who are tackling specific commercial issues or facing big strategic questions about their future direction.
For those starting up a business, you've got a great business idea but perhaps you're daunted about how to get started and what you'll need to do and master once you have started trading. We can help you develop your idea commercially and create your business plan. We can also help you work through your choices and provide training in the areas you'll need it.
For those already trading, you're really busy but that just doesn't seem to be translating into profit or perhaps you're struggling to work through a mind boggling decision about your business' future. You might feel awash with facts and figures and feel overwhelmed by the opportunities and risks.
