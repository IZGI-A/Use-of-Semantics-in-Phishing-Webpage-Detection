I've decided to try something new to end 2019. That new thing is organizing a free online conference for teachers. I'm calling it the Practical Ed Tech Creativity Conference
. It will be held over the course of three afternoons/ evenings in December (10-12). But I can't do it alone. So I'm looking for people who would like to share a creative classroom project.
Call for Proposals
If you have a creative project that you think other teachers would benefit from learning about in the course of a 30-45 webinar, please fill out the proposal form here
. If you've never presented in a webinar format before, I'll give you some training in advance.
Presentation Ideas
A few examples of creative projects that would be great fits for this online conference include a digital storytelling project with third graders, a video production with seventh graders, and an app development project with tenth graders. But don’t overthink it, any project that ends in students producing something that they’re excited about could be a good fit for this conference.
- Telling stories with digital comics.
- Multimedia mapping.
- Arduino or Raspberry Pi projects.
- Interesting ways to use augmented reality.
- Creative uses of virtual reality.
- Student podcasts.
- Hour of Code projects.
- Something that I’m sure I haven’t thought about.
