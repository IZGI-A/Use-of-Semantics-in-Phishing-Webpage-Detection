The Challenge
In America today, the circumstances children are born into predict the opportunities they will have in life. Our education system was not designed to enable all children to realize their potential or achieve their dreams.
16M
children in the U.S. live below the poverty line
2X
more children of color are born into poverty than are white children
14%
of children growing up in poverty will graduate from college within eight years of graduating high school
The Opportunity
While no single solution is enough to bring about an equitable and excellent education for all children, Teach For America has learned over three decades that dramatic progress is possible. Lasting change takes bold, grounded leaders working together, inside and outside of schools, fighting for the aspirations of children and their families.
Our Approach
Teach For America finds outstanding leaders who commit to expanding educational opportunity, beginning with at least two years teaching in an under-resourced public school. Working shoulder-to-shoulder with students, educators, and community members, corps members go beyond traditional expectations to support the academic and personal growth of their students. The impact corps members have in the classroom fuels a lifelong commitment to their students and shapes the trajectory of their lives and careers.
We are locally rooted and nationally connected.
Alumni and corps members work in partnership with rural and urban communities across the country, inside schools and from every sector that shapes education.Learn more about our regions
