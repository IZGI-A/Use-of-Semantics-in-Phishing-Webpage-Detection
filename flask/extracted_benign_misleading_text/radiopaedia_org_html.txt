Content types
Radiopaedia.org comprises two fundamental content types (articles and cases) and playlists (ordered collections of cases).

Playlists
Create and share playlists to help advance medical information around the globe. Curate focused playlists on specific topics for presentations to help other medical professionals teach radiology, or formulate quiz playlists to support medical students in their education. Find out more.
Editorial standards
The accuracy of Radiopaedia.org content is overseen by a dedicated group of volunteer editors who constantly review additions and changes to articles and cases, something that is facilitated by being spread around the globe through a variety of time zones.
Our editors also draw upon the knowledge of our expert advisers. Our expert advisers are known to not only be experts in their field and educators but to also support the radiology free open access medical education movement (#FOAMrad).
