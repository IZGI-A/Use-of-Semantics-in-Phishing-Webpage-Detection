At Pagely we set up the KnowAll theme as a pre-sales knowledge base for people evaluating our managed WordPress hosting service.
KnowAll has been a great asset to the Pagely sales process. The search feature provides a fast way to filter by keyword and the categorical organization gives a simple means to browse by topic. Analytics show us which articles are unclear and need refinement. Having it indexed by Google gives us SEO benefits.
We're happy customers of HeroThemes and endorse both the product and the support we've received from the company.
A lot of thought has gone into this theme, in how it looks, works and how both the user and admin interact with it.
In comparison to other knowledge based software available on the market, KnowAll does a wonderful job at a fraction of the cost.
KnowAll's extensive customization options have allowed us to make it our own both aesthetically and functionally and as a result it has increased engagement with our internal knowledge base.
We are happy that we chose KnowAll and would recommend it to others.
We expanded our support team from 1 full-time employee to 6 part-time employees, so we were looking for an easy way to share our knowledge to all (new) support employees. I've tried KnowAll and it was just what I was looking for.
Easy to set up, all employees understand it, great search, their support team responds in no time to tickets and it only costs $149. For us it is a no-brainer to keep using KnowAll.
