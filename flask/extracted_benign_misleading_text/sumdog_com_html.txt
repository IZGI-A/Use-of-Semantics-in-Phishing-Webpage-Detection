Children who struggle to submit maths homework at the end of the week take great pleasure in competing online with their friends and completing Sumdog homework challenges in exchange for coins and rewards. I have noticed a quickening of pupils’ mental agility in mathematics and a reinforcement of basic skills like addition, subtraction and times tables.
Sumdog was introduced at school in the autumn term, yet my children are still as enthusiastic about using it today as they were nearly 6 months ago. They love the games and are learning so much, without realising it. Not only is it noticeable that they are doing better with their school work and their homework, but also they are picking up newly introduced topics quicker and that gives them more confidence in their abilities.
