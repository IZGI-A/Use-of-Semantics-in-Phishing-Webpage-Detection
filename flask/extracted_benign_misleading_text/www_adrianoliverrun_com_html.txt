Virtual Adrian Oliver Memorial Run
October 17 - 18, 2020
Due to the unforeseeable impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s Adrian Oliver Memorial Run is going virtual.
Although we are saddened that we cannot come together in person with Adrian’s friends, colleagues and community supporters, we know that camaraderie and friendship knows no boundaries. There are still many ways to remain connected and supportive of one another during this challenging time.
While we may be keeping our distance from one another, we are excited to partner with AXON to bring you a real time ‘in-person’ experience throughout your race. From October 17 to October 18th, select runners will be fitted with the latest police body-worn cameras and we will live stream their race from multiple locations in which they serve across Canada.
Now more than ever, it is important we join together regardless of the colour of uniform, to share our stories and the true impact that service takes on the physical, mental health and spirits of those who serve, and their family members.
We thank you for your ongoing support and hope you will join us in supporting Honour House, a home away for first responders in need.
