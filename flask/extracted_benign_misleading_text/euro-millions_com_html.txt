How Will Brexit Affect EuroMillions?
The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 31st October 2019 but this will not have an impact on EuroMillions. Players from all nine participating countries – including the UK – will still be able to play EuroMillions after Brexit. In fact, most aspects of the game will remain exactly the same as they are now.
