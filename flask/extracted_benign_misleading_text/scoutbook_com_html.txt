Leaders
Leading young Scouts through the many adventures Scouting has to offer is one of the most fulfilling roles in the organization. But sometimes the act of leading can get lost in the act of reporting, limiting the amount of time spent with Scouts.
Scoutbook provides access to valuable tools and resources that will help with the day-to-day management of a unit, giving every leader more of what they need most: TIME.
