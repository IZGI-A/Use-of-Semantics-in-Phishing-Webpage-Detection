Outside Counsel, Reimagined
Find, hire and manage outside counsel without the costly infrastructure of a firm
Our clients access a rigorously vetted network of independent boutique firm and solo practitioners for on-demand expertise, overflow work and leave and headcount coverage.
We are a technology company. We use data and software to streamline the full lifecycle of our clients’ outside counsel engagements, from matching to billing and payments.
The efficiencies driven by our proprietary technology platform reduce our network lawyers’ overheads, enabling them to offer discounted rates for our clients.
