“My Arabic Interpreter did a great job assisting me. We were doing a medical history with a non-English speaking member. The call was long and time consuming. The interpreter was very patient. It surprised me that I didn't have to repeat the medical questions to her that I was asking the client.”– Nurse at a Major Health Care Insurance Company
