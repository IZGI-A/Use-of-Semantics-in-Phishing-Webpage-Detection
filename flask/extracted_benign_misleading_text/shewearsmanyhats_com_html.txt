This Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread, like most quick breads, is easy to make and is excellent for sharing as an edible gift throughout the holiday season. It’s a terrific slightly sweet treat. Try toasting it up to enjoy with a cup of tea! Delicious!

I’m tickled that you’re here! Like you, I wear many hats, and live to tell about it. This space is a place for sharing food, home, garden, travel and lifestyle tidbits, with some fun always thrown in for good measure.
