I’m Lee, the creator of the Easy Peasy homeschool curriculum. I’m the mother of six homeschooled children. I began putting my own children’s assignments online in 2011 as a way to preserve them. I purposely wrote them in such a way that others would be able to use them as well. In 2012 I started letting others know about it. My hope is that these sites will enable families to homeschool no matter what their life situation.
The high school site is set up similar to the lower school. You will choose your course load. There are recommendations on the site for how to do that, and if you choose a level on My EP, then it will assign the typical courses for the grade level chosen.
In the sidebar menu on the site, you can find “other courses” and “parent submitted” courses. These pages can be reached by using “other courses” in the My EP electives course block. These are not courses created by EP. I haven’t worked through them to check content. Some of them are in 180-day format, some aren’t. Some have tests and answers; some do not. Organizations and EP users have shared as a way to help each other out.
You can read my response to the questions “Is it enough?” and “How can this be free?”.
