Meraki Expeditions
meraki [may-rah-kee] (adjective)
This is a word that modern Greeks often use to describe doing something with soul, creativity, or love — when you put “a piece of yourself” into what you’re doing, whatever it may be.
What our Guests are saying
Charlotte Morgan
"I'd Do it All Again!
As a child hearing Greek myths, I fell in love with Greece and all things Greek. So my ideas of Greece were idealized and romantic and probably impossible to fulfill, BUT my trip to Poros and Athens with Mary Horner fulfilled every dream and more.
If you long for Greece, this is the trip for you. I returned and it was even better the second time. I’d go back again in a heartbeat and consider myself fortunate."
Pamela Jane Rogers, Author and Artist
Mary knows Greece!
"For those who want an authentically lavish Greek experience, Meraki Expeditions led by Mary Horner is the ideal choice! Since Mary’s first arrival Greece in 1984, each year she has continued to bring family and friends with her. I have seen her phenomenal growth into an exceptional travel director. Mary knows and loves Greece, adventurous travel, and goes to the furthest extent to make sure her travelers have the finest time of their lives. I’d follow her anywhere!"
