Hello, dear ones.
there is now a continued existence of add-ons (all). Not under xenMade.
I will hand over the project as such in about a week. If you don't want me to pass on your data/account - please write me. I will then delete the account - which also means the loss of licenses.
I don't know what changes will happen on the bottom line and I have no influence on it.
I am happy that the Add-Ons will be continued.
All licenses are retained and will be continued. Of course not if they have their account deleted.
