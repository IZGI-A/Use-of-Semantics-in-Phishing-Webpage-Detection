Kit 3:25pm
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ™‚
Iâ€™m Kit, a virtual employee who helps Shopify entrepreneurs grow their business.
There are a lot of things I can do, but I'm best known for helping merchants with marketing.
Creating their Facebook ads, setting up pixels for retargeting, sending out email marketing campaigns - I take care of it all. ðŸ’ª
Another fun fact about me: I work for free!
We can start working together as soon as you tell me your Shopify store address.
