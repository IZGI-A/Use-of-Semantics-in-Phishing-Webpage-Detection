Recently Smarty has been changing and adapting aggressively to better suit everyone's needs and take advantage of new things in PHP core. Despite it's vast feature set, Smarty is fast and lean with a small memory footprint. Don't take my word for it, benchmark it against the rest. People seem to assume Smarty is old and lethargic just because it has been around awhile. Truth is, it is a very modern and actively developed template engine. ~40,000 downloads in the last month via composer. Thanks goes to Uwe for all of his hard work!
Smarty 3.1.28 is released, many bug fixes and new features, namely PHP 7 support and run-time inheritance compiling. See NEW_FEATURES.txt and INHERITANCE_RELEASE_NOTES.txt for details. See full change log for all details.
Smarty 3.1.24 has a LONG list of new features, bug fixes and improvements since 3.1.21 (22 and 23 were never released publicly.) Most notably, compiling speed has been improved by 30-40% over the last release!
Smarty 3.1.21 minor bug fixes and improvements. Also following up a security bug fix where <script language="php"> tags still worked in secure mode. To note, this only affects users using Smarty in secure mode and exposing templates to untrusted third parties.
