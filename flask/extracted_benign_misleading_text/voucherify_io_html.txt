We are very pleased with the product and service we've received from Voucherify!
Selection of a technology service that is going to stay for a long is never an easy decision. I am happy that we have selected Voucherify, amongst many options available, as our partner to enable BQâ€™s voucher management. The product design is broad, well-thought-of and covers most of the use-cases. Tomasz, the founder, is really helpful and was always available even for the smallest assistance. The team is up to accommodate specific use-cases in their product roadmap. The documentation is certainly one of the best I came across in tech product eco-system.
Overall, a highly recommended product for coupons, referrals, gifting, and loyalty.
Voucherify offers a robust solution at a very competitive price. Their support team has been fabulous - they are responsive and quick to answer any questions that have come up.
