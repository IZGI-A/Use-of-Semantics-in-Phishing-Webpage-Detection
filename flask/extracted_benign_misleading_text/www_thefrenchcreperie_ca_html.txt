Bonjour !
I'm Evan, the Owner & Chef of The French Crêperie. I am currently a student athlete at the University of Alberta. I was born in France and immigrated to Canada 6 years ago.
My fondest memory growing up was baking crepes with my mom. When I was 8 my mom taught me how to bake the perfect crepe and I never stopped making them. I can’t wait to share my love for crepes with everyone.
