“I used to be a taxi driver in Mumbai for six years. But a dire
need of money forced me to leave my motherland and migrate to Saudi Arabia to earn
a living. I worked there as a private car driver and did well monetarily. But for
me, money couldn't replace the joy of working in my own motherland.
Five years later, I decided to return home. With my savings of Rs. 1 lakh, I started
a business dealing in scraps in Hyderabad. But then things didn't go too well and
I lost all my money in the business. My confidence took a big hit and I was back
to where I was – being an ordinary taxi driver. But somewhere in my heart I always
believed that those who try, can never fail.
From whatever I earned as a taxi driver, I managed to save Rs. 30,000. Using that,
I took up a three wheeler loan from Mahindra Finance to buy an Alfa Load. And thanks
to them, I am a proud owner of a vehicle. Since then, my earnings have considerably
increased and so has my respect in the society. Today, I feel much more confident
about myself and I am now looking forward to buying a second vehicle as soon as
the loan for the first one is over.
I am grateful to Mahindra Finance for helping me 'Rise' in my own country.”
