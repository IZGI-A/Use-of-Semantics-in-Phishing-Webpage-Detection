The implications are enormous, because connection leads to responsibility and responsibility leads to positive action. Positive action leads to a sustainable and flourishing Earth. When we embrace our Oneness with the Divine, one another, and all of Life, we drop from a mental, emotional state to our heart.
We move from a focus on the transactional to the relational. We breathe more easily and become relaxed. Honesty, openness, compassion and service become our focus. This creates health and well-being and reverses the kinds of dis-ease and illness that accompany an unhealthy lifestyle. No longer are we preoccupied with the idols of money, power and position. These things no longer form our definition of success.
Instead, we find meaning in bringing joy to others and helping them and ourselves be successful at living compassionate, spiritual lives of service to the Oneness we are.
