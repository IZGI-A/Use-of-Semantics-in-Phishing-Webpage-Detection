ICANNWiki is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to supporting the Internet community's collaborative development of wiki articles on ICANN and Internet Governance-related topics. The wiki provides neutral, third-party information for ICANN meeting attendees and Internet citizens at large. It is an open platform governed by wiki values, such as Neutral Point of View, transparency, assuming good faith, and building together. ICANNWiki is not ICANN. ICANNWiki is a separate non-profit organization independent from ICANN. This website is operated by the ICANNWiki organization and any donations made to the ICANNWiki website are for the ICANNWiki organization only."
The ICANNWiki Edit-a-thon is a community-centered learning and sharing event that focuses on collaboratively building Internet governance related content on ICANNWiki. This session features hands-on instruction and sharing between ICANNWiki and interested participants. By operating as a neutral, community-driven resource ICANNWiki ensures that the community feels empowered to build and research information related to how the Internet's resources are governed. Our aim in hosting these events is to lower the barrier to the information available, shine a light on it and, when possible, localize it for a stronger, more empowered, global community.
ICANN65, the 2019 Policy Forum, will be an important meeting with continued focus on the Expedited Policy Development Process (EPDP) on the Temporary Specification for Generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD) Registration Data, as well as a variety of other critical issues.
