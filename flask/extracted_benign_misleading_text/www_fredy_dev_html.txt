I remember when I was around 13 years old when my dad bought the first second-hand computer, I was fascinated. I used to go to the local internet coffee shop to download all kinds of software and save them in a USB stick, to use them on my home computer later on. I remember that some of them needed a patch or a crack so I can use them without pay. I didn't know about copyright back then. I remember thinking, who was responsible for this patches? Maybe I could do it too. That is when I started to investigate about debugging and The Assembly language and discovered the reverse-engineering world. Using a program called OllyDBG, I came to unpack various programs trying to get the precious validation key, just for fun. I think that's when everything started. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
