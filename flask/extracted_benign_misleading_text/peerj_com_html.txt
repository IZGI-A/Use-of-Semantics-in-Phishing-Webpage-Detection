Advisors and Academic Editors at PeerJ are experienced researchers who are experts in their respective fields. As a general rule, Academic Editors must be at Principal Investigator level or above and have published 25 or more peer-reviewed journal articles. Editors are vetted before being appointed, and their decisions are overseen for consistency.
149 institutions have prepaid PeerJ article fees, helping reduce publishing costs and making it easier for their researchers to publish Open Access.
PeerJ works with major conferences and societies through sponsorships and curated collections to highlight societal member and conference delegate work. Collections are available for in-depth peer-reviewed research articles as well as conference abstracts.
