Invented by Don Clifton to Empower Human Development
It isn't until people know what makes them talented and unique that they know how to perform better in their job. Or how to find one that's a better fit. And to build better relationships and be a better teammate. And to feel like they're improving. Every. Single. Day.
That's what Don Clifton meant when he wrote:
"There is no more effective way to empower people than to see each person in terms of his or her strengths."
