“Your website rocks. I think you have saved me like a million hours of crying over my first Grad School paper.”

“I’m really enjoying your app, it’s really useful, currently using it as my bibliography for my dissertation!”

“Thank you so much for creating this website.
EasyBib became slowly so unbearable with ads, and then when it became acquired by the evil Chegg
I lost hope and thought I’d have to cite things manually.
As a student who just wants to get assignments done quickly and easily, you’ve helped me and everyone else.
I can’t thank you enough for not only making an easy alternative to RefME that I used to treasure as a student
who needs to write frequently, but also making it free, you’re truly a saint. Keep doing what you’re doing.”
Eric Tober

“I just wanted to thank you personally for creating something so valuable.
I’m a professor of law and sociology at Donghua University in Shanghai, China.
Citationsy has helped me in my personal research and I recommend it to all my thesis
students as one of the important first steps in their thesis creation.
I have found Citationsy to be highly intuitive and very user-friendly.
And the archive function is extremely useful, providing valuable research
in a way that both Google Scholar and our private university platform cannot.
In addition, when I had a few questions about how to reference certain forms of research,
I emailed the customer service and received quick, polite and helpful replies,
which solved the problem efficiently. It’s a pleasure to use your software and
I highly recommend it to all who are writing academic papers and doing higher-level research.”
David Warner, Esq.

“Thank you. About a week ago, Citationsy saved me from monotonous irritation.
Easybib.com and citationmachine.com were about to drive me absolutely crazy with their ads and constant website malfunction.
I can’t believe I went through 16 years of school without a tool as simple and adaptable as Citationsy.
So thanks for your hard work on this! It’s making writing a tremendous amount less frustrating.”
Jake McCown
Spring Arbor University
“Thank you so much for making this. I loved RefMe, and this is shaping up to be the perfect replacement for it.”
“Almost makes me want to take an English class again just so I can use it. Very nice work! I’ll be sure to spread the word.”
“I think I was an EasyBib user back in the day, and I’m glad to see that you’ve stepped in to fill the void in this space. EndNote is just so cost prohibitive and slow to accommodate web-first sourcing.”
“I was looking for an app with which I can do and also change my references from one referencing system to another. Endnote is probably world leader, but I wanted something cheaper, plus, being a postdoc currently there is still a bit of movement in my career and not every university has Endnote, meaning that I would constantly export and re-export references, which is precisely what I not wanted.
Enter Citationsy. This app allows me to look for literature using DOI, ISBN, article name etcetera, I can also simply scan the book (in case I reference a book). It does an awesome job in changing the referencing system, which is so important as long as publishers are not using one system. I have it on my iPad but also on the web, so I have access to my references everywhere where I have internet, and it is free!
I had a little bug with reference order, but wrote the support and had an answer within the hour — problem solved. I highly, highly recommend this app!”
“Wish I had this as a student!”
“Citationsy is fabulous for a host of reasons […] Citationsy is online and connected to your account, so you can access it from any computer once you log in, unlike some other citation managers that are tied to your desktop. […] It does a great job of pulling information from the web or from publications given the title of the reference you are using. Perhaps most importantly, even though it is free it does not bombard you with ads the way some other free citation managers do, which essentially renders them useless. Citationsy has become my go-to citation manager (often more than the traditional ones!). References can easily be copied all at once for pasting into the document where they are needed as a bibliography.”
“It’s a really good service — thank you. I was using RefME before when I needed a quick tool for references. This replaces it and is even better.”
“I honestly can’t even express how happy I was to come across Citationsy!
I’m Gillian, an MA International Relations student at the University of Kent.
Whilst I was doing my undergrad in Politics I was using Refme.
I believe it was bought out by CiteThisForMe and things just took a horrible turn. I’m sure you’ve come across it yourself so I won’t need to explain why it’s so bad 😂
But back to your platform, I love it!
So clean, simple and straightforward and even the fact that I can drop you a quick message is so lovely - not an experience you get everyday.”

“Thanks for this wonderful initiative.
It quite reduces stress and time wastage.”

“
Love it! Read your article
and came here. Delivered as promised! Saved lots of time and helped me move out of citethisforme forever!”

“I am a sophomore doing online school and I absolutely LOVE Citationsy.
I use the app on my Mac every time I need to cite something!
I have and still do suggest Citationsy to anyone that does any typing.
It is a super useful tool!”

“Kudos to you for making online accessibility to journal articles as easy as possible.”
Sam Ogundeji

“I remember my first time trying to do a citation for an assignment.
It was sooooo! painful trying to get the “.” & “,” & dates etc. in the right place for fear of losing marks.
So When I discovered “RefMe” I thought I had “died and gone to heaven.” I emailed everyone that I could think of to introduce them
to this wonderful program. It was simple, it did the job perfectly, compatible, and it just worked.
So Yes! I feel your pain when “Refme Left Me.” and was replaced by citethisforme, which in my opinion is not worthy of
quotation marks was another painfil experience, which lost me marks and I paid for it thinking it would be as good as and/or better
than “RefMe.”
So you go for it, Cenk.”
“Citationsy is great, it helps me so much! Thank you”
Vincenzo Landolfo
“Great Job! I can’t wait to try this. I wrote my first book with RefMe
and was horrified when it became CiteThisForMe, which is awful.”
“It’s been a long time since I last had to scrape together references,
but I remember what a terrible process it was. Cheers to you Cenk for taking the matter into your own hands and building
the tool the way you think it should be. I’m sure others will see the value as Citationsy gains more traction.
Chegg should be ashamed of the way they’ve twisted and abducted services that students were relying upon so fervently.”
“Congrats! Best citation software I've ever used. I don't use anything else since I found yours!”
“This is the kind of app I wish existed when I was at university - footnotes and bibliographies caused me so much pain!”
Author
“Really helpful as an extra way to go over my work late at night before a deadline. There are a wealth of styles available and ways to cite images, podcasts, etc. I love this tool. I would recommend this over other citation tools I’ve tried […] This helps me have better quality work and higher confidence in citations.”
“Fast and easy citations and referencing. A great support system, replied instantly to my complaint when I had one. Their citation archive makes you search for publications online with one click. Citationsy saved me from all the complexity I face when citing and referencing.”
“Congratulations on the platform! I found it excellent!
It will solve several difficulties in the process of managing my academic references.
The design and the usability are also great, simple and smart.”
Bruno Costa Teixeira

“I am a medical professional (cardiologist). I find that Citationsy is excellent! A very useful tool!”

“When I found Citationsy, it was out of desperation.
EasyBib had done something to their site that made it difficult to access with my screen reader.
(I’m totally blind.) And I was just finished writing a paper, and I needed to create a references page right the heck now.
Well, I panicked.
All the bibliography creation services out there seemed to have been bought out by the same company, and they were all alike.
Well, what was I going to do? I had a paper due by midnight and I had to have a list of references.
It was through persistence and google that I finally located this tool, and it works very well with screen reading technology.
Thanks for creating something that doesn’t suck, that blind college students can actually use!”
Krista Pennell

“Citationsy has been of immense help for me for my thesis
for the past 6 months. 6 more to go. Just want to let you know you making it very easy for students like me who
live in Pakistan. Much respect.”

“I used to use EasyBib. But it is completely unusable now.
In frustration, I started looking for a new go-to citation generator.
Every single one of them is exactly the same. The name at the top is different, but everything else is identical.
I can’t stand it. After scrolling through pages of web searches, looking for a spam-free generator,
I found articles claiming to have the list of the best ones. And those were chegg too.
I want to express to you that a non-chegg resource management tool is NOT a niche market.
This is needed, badly. And thank you.”
“Life saver!! All week I’ve been looking for an alternative to RefMe for my
dissertation — I was on placement year when they decided to do the switch!
I’ve just started to use Citationsy and have shared it to all my friends because it’s so easy and simple to use!”
“Just writing in today to express my heartfelt gratitude to the team for having created this really amazing product.
I actually just found out about it a few weeks back while searching for a no-fuss citation manager for use now that I am back in school.
To be honest? It has been a godsend in so many ways — and the fact that it is free for everyone to use? — you guys are undoubtedly a blessing to all.”
Adib Zailan
“Thank you for your creation, it is intuitive and helpful and wonderful! I am writing my thesis right now, and I would have had to throw myself off a cliff if I had to cite 50 references by hand without Citationsy!!!
THANK YOU A MILLION TIMES”
Alden Sova
Oregon State University
“So much better than any other site for citations. Easy to use and citing my sources so simple to do. This is the best website for citing sources hands down.”
Caleb Brown
“Finding citations to journals, links, websites and many others is really easy with Citationsy. It is as simple as just pasting the link on Citationsy and have it do the rest. Before I started using Citationsy, it was ridiculously difficult to find suitable references and citations as applicable to some links and websites, but once I started using it, it has removed the stress and the waste of time trying to do it myself.”
“Just wanted to say that Citationsy is the best and I recommend it to students in class all the time. I find it has been a really nice complement to Mendeley (and it's more user-friendly imho). So, thanks!”
Kelsey
University of Minnesota
“
Until yesterday, I have been using Bibme (another citation platform) and I have been struggling with the bibliography for my research project.
Bibme is 2/3 ads and 1/3 website. And the color scheme is not my definition of pleasant.
I searched ‘How do I cite answers from Quora’ and came across Citationsy. Judging from the modern and clean interface, I signed up immediately.
With zero exaggeration, making my bibliography went from ‘I want to die!’ to ‘I didn’t know citing sources could actually be so much fun’.
Redid my bibliography and completed it in no time.”
