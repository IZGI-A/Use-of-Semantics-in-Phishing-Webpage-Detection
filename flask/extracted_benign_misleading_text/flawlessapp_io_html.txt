Flawless App is integrated right inside your iOS simulator as a plugin. It allows you to fix visual issues on the fly, before they cost you time and money.
No need to distract your development workflow by adding any third-party library. Flawless App works out of the box, without any additional setup.
Select any image or Sketch file and it gets overlayed inside iOS Simulator.
Choose comparison mode to spot any visual differences between the expected design and real app.
Generate a GIF of comparison. Share it with your team to save time on design review.
Using Flawless App, I don't have to wait for designers to point out any mistakes I made while building a UI – I can find them and fix them myself, while I’m still working on it. I highly recommend trying Flawless App out, to see just how much quicker it can make your UI development.
Available exclusively on the Mac for just $35.
Flawless App is for macOS only!
