I've fixed the implementation of the MobileFrontend extension, so for anyone who cares about that sort of thing, the more mobile/tablet-friendly site version should be available from https://m.1d4chan.org/ again (there's also links at the bottom of each page for toggling mobile/desktop view). Apparently it upsets google if your site doesn't have a mobile-friendly version. --Wikifag (talk) 13:23, 8 April 2017 (UTC)
About
Welcome to 1d4chan, a site devoted to the description and archival of all sorts of things interesting and relevant to /tg/ (the "traditional games" board of 4chan), including articles on fa/tg/uy culture, memes particular to (or at least commonly used on) /tg/, games and systems played by its browsers, interesting fluff thereof, and writefaggotry posted to the board. In addition to this, users are free to use the wiki to store information about online campaigns they are running, or as a platform for collaborative effort on homebrewn game systems or settings.
The wiki is hosted and administrated by Wikifag, although his time is limited and he cannot monitor it non-stop. If an issue has arisen which you believe needs immediate attention (a prominent example would be if the site has gone down or is extremely sluggish, as it may be some time before he notices, or someone has uploaded illegal material to the server) then he can be reached by emailing wikifag [at] 1d4chan [dot] org.
Conduct
- No egoboos 1d4chan is NOT for pages dedicated to specific browsers of /tg/, namefag or tripfag, regardless of how well-known or liked/disliked they are. The only exception to this is the drawfag page, which may list known drawfags and describe their usual subject matter. Please refrain from qualitative analysis of a given drawfag's talents or personality, as drama will inevitably ensue.
- No wars in the article If you find yourself in an edit war or anything similar with another user, move your argument to the article's discussion page. If you observe a dispute over an article and have an opinion one way or the other about it, comment on the discussion. Wikifag prefers to get input from as many people as possible before he has to make some sort of administrative decision about a given issue.
- Campaigns in the Campaign: namespace If you intend to use the wiki as storage for pages about your campaign, your main page should be at Campaign:Name and other related pages should be at Campaign:Name/Stuff. Your pages should also link to each other to avoid them appearing on the orphaned pages list. Wikifag won't punish users for forgetting to do this, but it helps keep the wiki tidy!
- Use the Setting: namespace for articles related to homebrew (as opposed to offical) settings, following the same syntax.
- Deleting pages If you find a page that needs deleting, put the {{deletion}} template on it (by including that markup at the top of the page) and it will be added to the deletion category. Pages that should be deleted are pages for campaigns that are no longer running or no longer needed for that campaign, and pages of very low quality or subject matter unrelated to /tg/. Note that the criteria for "related to /tg/" is somewhat lax, and well-written pages that justify even a tangential relation to /tg/ are likely to be allowed to remain.
- Block Policy See the Policy page for a clarification of what behaviors are considered block-worthy. In short: vandalism and (excessive) edit-warring warrants a block of a few days, and link-spammers get permanently blocked. Use the talk page instead of the "undo" link.
