Welcome to our website! We make science videos and we create extra resources for you to get the most out of the videos we make. Peruse our blogs and the tree of life, our biology guide, and our biomes videos. Have fun exploring…
Our mission at Untamed Science is to make science education fun. It doesn’t matter if you’re an armchair scientist, a student, a teacher or a scientist yourself. Our goal is to create these science videos and articles that are enjoyable to learn from! If you’re a teacher, we hope they inspire your students to become lifelong learners.
This site is divided up into a few main sections, each of which is created as a unique resource. We have a tree of life that has interesting science videos on biology and ecology on the great taxonomic tree of our world’s species. We have a biology portal designed to cover everything students would cover in biology. We also have a site dedicated to learn how to make your own science videos.
We hope you enjoy what we’re creating. Start by watching our science videos from the comfort of your own home. Just sit back and click away!
