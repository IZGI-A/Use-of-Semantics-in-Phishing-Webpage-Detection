Prince and the Purple Rain Era Studio Sessions 1983 and 1984
Duane Tudahl
We highly recommend and endorse the Prince and the Purple Rain Era Studio Sessions 1983 and 1984 (Expanded Edition, paperback) book, by Duane Tudahl.
This is an updated edition of the fantastic book that provides incredible detail about Prince's studio sessions in 1983 and 1984. This 2018 paperback edition has 30 pages more information with newly uncovered dates and new interviews with people that reached out to Duane after his first book was published. Over 20 years of research by Duane Tudahl has provided a look behind the curtain, revealing the sheer brilliance of Prince's work in the studio. Duane Tudahl, like some PrinceVault staff members has been associated with Uptown Magazine and the bulk of the details on studio sessions and dates on PrinceVault is based his research, along with other Uptown Magazine writers. This book is the next level of that research. For nearly every song between 1983 and 1984, Duane Tudahl has uncovered more detailed information and presents it in a fresh and exciting narrative that takes the reader into the studio with Prince, revealing the creative process.
We are very pleased that Duane Tudahl has one more graciously allowed us to update pages on PrinceVault with the new information from the updated book. We would like to strongly encourage you to https://www.amazon.com/Prince-Purple-Rain-Studio-Sessions/dp/1538114623/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8 use this link] to purchase the updated edition of the book. Princevault.com provides the specifications, the book provides the story that is Prince and the Purple Rain Era Studio Sessions.
