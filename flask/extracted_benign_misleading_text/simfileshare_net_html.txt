That’s no filesize limits, no bandwidth limits, no premium options, and no login required to download.
Organise your files, find out who's downloading them, and make your favourite creators feel appreciated!
Sim File Share can only be used by simmers, for sharing sims-related files. This means we can focus on the needs of creators and downloaders, rather than trying to cater for everyone.
We know simmers like to post their links and then never touch them again. So the original URLs for your files will never stop working.
We won’t delete your files just because they’re old, haven’t been downloaded in a while, or because you haven’t logged in recently. The only time we’ll delete files is if we receive a legitimate, confirmed copyright complaint.
We don’t plan on ever closing Sim File Share. But if we do have to close the site, we’ll share all public files with Sims 2 Graveyard, Simscave, and other rehosting sites before we go.
All Sim File Share users get an unlimited number of invites to give away to fellow simmers. So if you know someone who uses Sim File Share, send them a message!
If you already have an invite code, you can redeem it here.
If you don't know anyone you can ask for an invite, you can request an account using this form. Using an invite code will be quicker, especially if we get backlogged, but we'll get to you as soon as we can!.
