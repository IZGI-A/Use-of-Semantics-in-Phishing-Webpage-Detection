Emily Barber holds a BA in political science and enjoys thick Turkish coffee and waking up in countries she has never before visited with her husband and duo partner, Chris Wegert. Throughout high school Emily competed in martial arts and women’s wrestling, transitioning to ju jitsu and running 5ks while studying for her degree in northern Virginia. After graduation, knee injury forced her to explore other outlets to challenge herself and a twist of fate brought her to the world of circus. Beginning with aerial straps, then moving on to silks, hoop, and trapeze, Emily discovered and cultivated her passion for performing high above the ground. She has trained in Montreal and performs regionally throughout the year, developing solo and duo routines on silks, hoop, trapeze, and straps. Emily is an instructor in aerial silks, trapeze, and hoop as well, travels extensively and teaches workshops internationally.
