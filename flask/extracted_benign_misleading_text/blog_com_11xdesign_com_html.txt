Suggested article from our blog: What is Round-Robin DNS and how to set it up?
This is what Round-Robin DNS is:
A fast and easy way to manage the DNS traffic. When you are getting heavy traffic, it could be a great idea to have your website or application hosted in different places. Then you will need a load balancer like the Round-Robin DNS to redirect the traffic to those locations. It will do it based on a statistical model.
Here you can find Round-Robin example configuration!
How does it work?
Imagine this scenario. You have a website with a single domain and 5 web servers with identical copies of your site. The users will ask for a resolution for their DNS request, but they will get a different IP address, depending on when they requested it. The first will get the IP of the first web server. The second user will get the second IP address, and so on. After the fifth, the Round-Robin DNS will start the sequence again, and that way, it will balance the load between the 5 web servers, providing, overall, better traffic management.
