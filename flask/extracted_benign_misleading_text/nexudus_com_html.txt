We are constantly amazed by Nexudus and the team behind it. The program is incredibly user-friendly, highly customizable, and covers every element of running a coworking space.
They've even introduced features that we hadn't considered in the past, but have become a vital part of how we run our coworking spaces. As we manage our three locations and expand nationally through a franchise model, Nexudus is a crucial piece of our success. Having the ability to manage everything within one program has made our staff more efficient and our members love how easy it is to use!
