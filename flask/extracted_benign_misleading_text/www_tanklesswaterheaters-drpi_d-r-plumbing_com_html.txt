Tankless Water Heaters Explained
Tankless water heaters, are known around the world as "combi" boilers, instantaneous, continuous flow, inline, flash, on-demand or instant-on water heaters, and POU (point of use) heaters. The chief advantages of tankless water heaters is a continuous flow of hot water and by saving energy (as compared to storage water heaters). These water heaters heat the water as the water flows through the device, and do not retain any water internally except for what is in the heat exchanger coil.
Tankless water heaters can be divided into two categories: "full on/full off" and "modulated". Full on/full off units do not have a variable power output level; the unit is either on or off. Modulated tankless water heaters base the heat output on the flow of water running through the unit. This is usually done through the use of a 'flow sensor', modulating gas valve, inlet water temperature sensor and an outlet water temperature sensor-choke valve and means that the occupants should receive the same output temperature of water at differing velocities.
Tankless heaters are more efficient than storage water heaters. The absence of a tank saves energy as conventional water heaters have to reheat the water in the tank as it cools off, called standby loss.
Tankless Water Heater Installation Requirments
The most important requirement of any whole house gas tankless water heater in the gas piping size. Gas piping is sized by CFH (cubic feet per hour) which is converted from the BTU imput of the heater. For example, a standard 50 gallon storage water heater has an input btu of approximently 38,000 BTUs. In comparison, a whole house tankless water heater is 200,000 BTUs. When converting from a storage heater to a tankless heater the gas line will need to be upgraded to allow for the additional btu requirements. The unit will not work on an under sized gas supply and will void most warranties.
The exhaust venting requires a special vent, unless the unit can be mounted on an outside wall or the whole unit mounted outside.
