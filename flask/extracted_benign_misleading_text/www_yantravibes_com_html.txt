About us
Hey there!
We are Anabel & Jobanna, together we make up Yantra Vibes Photography. Based out of Sonoma County, California (North bay area).
We are an adventurous, empathetic dynamic duo ready to capture your story, big or small.
We are a pair of young and old souls persistent to make our passion a living. We are more than your photographers. We are your personal creators, stylists, and friends. We strive to make a long-lasting bond with our clients, we'll be there to photograph every milestone of your lives as your life evolves.
Yantra Vibes Photography was inspired by the Vedic culture view of the sacred geometry symbol, Sri Yantra. The symbol is referred to as the "engine" as it is supposed to create something new and set it into motion. In simple terms, it's the symbol of creation.
With this in mind, we vowed to create magic with our photography and the experience you have with us.
We believe in the power of feelings and we want to help you express those feelings through our lens.
Our work consists of candid emotions with slight posing. We know how much greater the impact of emotion can be when caught on camera.
This being said, we will make sure you look and FEEL your absolute best during a session with us.
Contact us today to see if we are the right fit for you (:
