We are filmmakers who created Hollywood Camera Work to solve the problems that no one else was solving. Our courses and software come from decades of intense work on cracking the code of filmmaking and storytelling, and making maps that actually lead somewhere.
"Everything a Director needs to know
about camera work is brilliantly presented.
It's film school in a box."
