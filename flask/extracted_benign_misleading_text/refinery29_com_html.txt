This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar technologies to
Our website uses cookies, which are small text files (often including a unique identifier), that
Cookies that we use may help you to navigate the website, may be used to deliver content specific to your interests and to prevent you from having to re-enter your username and password each time you access the website. We may also use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the sites, to deliver editorial content, to record requests for subscriptions, to personalize information and to collect aggregate website usage information.
We use the following types of cookies:
The types of cookies described above may be "session cookies" which are temporary cookies that are only stored on your device while you are visiting our website, or "persistent cookies" which are cookies that are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our website.
Third Party Cookies: Some of our third party partners (including advertisers and marketing services companies) may set and access cookies and similar technologies on your computer as well, or we may do so on their behalf. These cookies may provide information to those third parties about your browsing habits and may help them to identify if certain services they provide are being used and to serve advertisements that are more relevant to you. We do not have control over how these third parties use such cookies and similar technologies or the information derived therefrom.
Web Beacons: We may also use “web beacons” (also known as “clear GIFs” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, on our website and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message. A web beacon is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a web page or message.
A web beacon helps us to understand whether you came to our website from an online advert displayed on a third party website, measure successes of email marketing campaigns and improve our website performance. They may also enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your personally identifiable information.
In many instances, web beacons are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
You can delete cookies by changing your privacy preferences in your Internet browser or by using the menu made available on the cookie banner. You also have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of our website that depend on cookies.
Some of the network advertisers, ad agencies and other vendors we work with to serve ads on third party websites and across the internet, or analytics providers which provide us with information regarding use of the website and effectiveness of our ads may be members of the Network Advertising Initiatives, the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.
