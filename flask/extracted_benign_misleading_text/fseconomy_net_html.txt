Welcome to FSEconomy!
FSEconomy is an environment where flight simulation enthusiasts can add a new aspect to their flying. Since 2005, FSEconomy has allowed over 10,000 registered simulator pilots to earn in-game virtual money by flying general aviation aircraft to and from nearly every airport on Earth. With those virtual earnings, pilots can purchase their own airplanes, join or start virtual businesses with other members, operate FBOs, and more - all within the free world of FSEconomy. FSEconomy adds a new dimension to your flight simulation experience, and that doesn't even count all the people you will meet along the way.
