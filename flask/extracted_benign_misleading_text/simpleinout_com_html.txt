Replace your punch clock, time cards, and calculator with a modern approach that saves you time and includes all the benefits of Simple In/Out. Utilizing our app TimeClock and a device in a common area, your users can check in and out with a simple scan of their employee badge.
Simple In/Out for your phone can be configured to keep your status up-to-date automatically by carrying the device in and out of your office. We have a range of solutions depending on your phone platform and your physical environment. Geofences use low-power location technology in a way that respects the user's privacy and works on all our phone platforms. Beacons rely on your phone detecting a Bluetooth signal from a physical device you can purchase pre-configured from our Store. Networks use your existing WiFi Network to check you in/out based on your phone connecting for internet access (only supported on Android and Windows Phone).
Our Desktop apps can be configured to automatically update your status based on your computer's activity. If you step away for a period of time, Simple In/Out can check you out, and when you return we'll check you back in. Learn More
