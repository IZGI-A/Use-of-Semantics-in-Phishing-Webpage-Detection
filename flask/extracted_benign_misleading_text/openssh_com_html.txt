OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol. It encrypts all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. In addition, OpenSSH provides a large suite of secure tunneling capabilities, several authentication methods, and sophisticated configuration options.
The OpenSSH suite consists of the following tools:
OpenSSH is developed by a few developers of the OpenBSD Project and made available under a BSD-style license.
OpenSSH is incorporated into many commercial products, but very few of those companies assist OpenSSH with funding.
Contributions towards OpenSSH can be sent to the OpenBSD Foundation.
