At The Polyclinic, our primary care physicians bump elbows with our orthopedists. Our allergists share a coffee pot with our cardiologists. Our podiatrists are down the hall from physical therapy. So when you come to The Polyclinic, you're not just seeing one doctor, you're tapping into a dedicated team with a wealth of experience and expertise. A team with one goal: to do what's right for you.
