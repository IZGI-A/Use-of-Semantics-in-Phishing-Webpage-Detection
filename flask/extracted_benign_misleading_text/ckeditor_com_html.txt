The last month I had a pleasure to work closely with CKEditor 5, integrating it into Neos CMS. I was never really a fan of CKEditor 4, but CKEditor 5 has become one of my favorite opensource projects.

Back in 2012, I started to research tools to get a real-time collaborative editor working on Rails. I just achieved that tonight. The trick was to wait years for a team of super talented devs to solve this super hard problem. Thanks, CKEditor!
