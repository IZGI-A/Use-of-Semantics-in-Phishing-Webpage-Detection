Whether you are Steve Geisler or Paul Campion or a Gnomon student just starting out; 3D.SK is absolutely essential.
A big Thank You from the Playstation Family. Your websites are truly visionary.
Great site. An absolute incredible resource for artists (and I do not think I am using hyperbole here). I've been frustrated by the lack of such resources on the Internet (or even in books), too many are too pornographic for most artists to use, or are too poor quality to be of much use, or offer far too few pose choices (and usually charge far too much for such small offerings). For the cost of a couple of artist books one can have full access to your site for a year and the many poses the site contains. Plus, what book lets its customers request poses? I kept saying to myself "excellent, great, finally, now that's what I've been looking for for quite awhile" and so on as I perused (and downloaded) the various pose galleries. I've returned to my core love of writing and drawing lately (life is too short) and it is so great to find a site that helps one "have a nice and creative day."David Merchant
