You Deserve Better
For too long, women have had to put up with tights that just don't fit. It's not just you! 90% of women can't find comfortable tights.
Why? Because, traditionally all tights have been the same width, only varying by leg length. Weâ€™ve changed all that.
Snag started in Edinburgh in 2018 with a simple mission - to make comfortable, fun tights for everyone. Our products are engineered to fit all body shapes, from size 4 to size 36.
Since then we've sold more than 750,000 pairs of tights and 70% of our customers say having tights that fit has made their lives FUNDAMENTALLY better.

What's New
Our Ethics
We started Snag to make sure that anyone who wants to wear tights can have comfortable, affordable tights that fit - regardless of size, shape, gender or anything else.
We are passionate about doing business the right way. Our tights are made in Italy by a family-owned factory that has been making tights for over 75 years. We ensure everyone involved in the manufacture production of our tights are paid a living wage.
Our tights are vegan and we don't use any plastic in our packaging. We are constantly working to be as kind to the environment as possible.
Sizing
We believe in sizing so you get a great fit! So we take into account your size, height and body shape. First select your body shape - curvilicious or athletic, then trace across from your height and dress size.
