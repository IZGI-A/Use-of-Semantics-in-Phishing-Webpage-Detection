Expired Domain Names478 TLDs supported and rising!
Thousands of domain names expire every day. The reasons are different. Some owners forgot to renew the domains, some just don't want them anymore or they moved on to other projects. For most people these so called Expired Domains don't have any value. They just see a bunch of Domain Names someone else deleted and move on, but for the people who know about SEO or the value of good Backlinks, Expired Domain Names are money just waiting to get picked up from the street. The only problem is to separate the good ones from the bad ones. That is where ExpiredDomains.net comes into play.

Depending on the domain extension you can search through thousands of domains every day before they get released to the public and pick what you like. ExpiredDomains.net currently supports 478 TLDs.

Pending Delete Domain Status
After a domain expires, it will pass through a number of states, before it gets deleted. The last state before the deletion is the Pending Delete State. Read more about it here.
The Domain Details Page now also accepts Names without a TLD
You can now view any name on the domain details page (e.g. /domain/example). If the details page receives a domain name (without tld), it will show you the availability of the domain name in all found tlds and the similar domains result. If it receives a valid domain (with tld), it will also try to find information about the domain.

Also all adwords queues for sedo domains are now processed.

Added a Listing Anchor Tag
