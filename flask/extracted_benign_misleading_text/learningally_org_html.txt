Our solution provides students who struggle to read due to a reading deficit with equitable access to all the books they need to and want to read, including curriculum-aligned text books and literature, popular fiction and more. With an extensive library of human-read audiobooks and a suite of educator tools and resources, we help struggling readers become engaged, independent learners.
Learning Ally's College Success Program will give you the tools, including a modern version of books on tape, online resources and the support you need as you navigate your college journey and prepare for your future career.
Our heritage serving dyslexic, blind, and visually-impaired students powerfully positions us to help even more children in the future.
