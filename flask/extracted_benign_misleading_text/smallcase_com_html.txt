Investing in for the long-term
In past 2 decades, annualised returns show that equity has outperformed other asset classes, making it the best investment for long-term. In long term, you keep emotions at bay so you don’t make hasty decisions. smallcases are ideal for taking long-term exposure (at least 3 years) to themes or strategies that you believe in.
Who are smallcases for?
smallcases can be used by all investors irrespective of your experience:
First Time Investors: Don’t pick stocks you don’t understand. Invest in readymade portfolios that are centred around familiar ideas instead.
Mutual Fund Investors: Enjoy more flexibility & control over your investments at lower fees. With smallcases, everything is transparent
Seasoned Investors: Take portfolio exposure to trending ideas & established strategies or create & manage your own portfolios with smallcases
How do I choose a smallcase?
You should choose a smallcase with an idea that you think will do well in the long term. Also, smallcases have risk labels - Low, Moderate & High, so choose a smallcase based on your risk appetite
You can filter based on the type, investment amount, etc to find a smallcase that’s best for you. You can also build your portfolio with the core-satellite approach
Fees and Taxes
The charges for investing in smallcases are as per the broker’s guidelines and only apply when you transact. Visit the help page on your broker platform for more information.
For smallcases of stocks, the taxes are the same as equities - Long-Term Capital Gains (> 1 year of holding) are 10% of the total gains (if gains for the year exceed ₹1 lakh) and Short-Term Capital Gains (< 1 year of holding) are 15% of the total gains.
For ETF smallcases, each ETF has its own taxation. Check the smallcase FAQs on your broker platform for a breakdown of the ETF taxes.
- Understanding smallcases
How are smallcases better than mutual funds?
smallcases and mutual funds both help you take portfolio exposure to equities, but unlike mutual funds, smallcases are:
Transparent & Customizable - you can view stocks you are investing into & change them as well
Direct Ownership - You buy the underlying stocks into your account directly
Liquid - No lock-in periods, so you may exit anytime. But, smallcases work best when used for long-term investing
Simple to understand - smallcases are built around relatable themes like Affordable Housing, Smart Cities, etc).
Read more on how they are different
Why is direct ownership important?
Unlike mutual funds where you get units of the fund, with smallcases, you invest in the stocks directly. You can buy or sell stocks anytime without any lock-in periods.
While there is flexibility & control with smallcases, you should start SIPs and hold smallcases for the long-term (at least 3 years).
Benefits of investing in ETFs
An ETF tracks an index (Eg: NiftyBEeS is ETF that tracks NIFTY). So there is no need for active management as its performance is line with the index. ETF expense ratios can be as low as 0.10% - meaning more returns for you. Read more on why we chose ETFs for the All Weather Investing smallcase
How can I earn dividends?
Dividends are awarded periodically by a company to investors out of its profits or reserves. They are additional gains over the capital gains on the stocks. With smallcases, all dividends declared are credited to your bank account directly. There are smallcases available that are centred around dividend strategies

Watchlist and Drafts
You can track the performance & risk a smallcase before investing by adding it to your watchlist. Similarly, when you create a smallcase, you can save them as drafts before investing to track how they perform. You can always edit your drafts.
Creating your own portfolio
If you have a list of (up to 50) stocks that you like or have been recommended by a trusted source, you can also create your own smallcase. You can also save it as a draft to track its performance before investing.
Orders and History
All orders placed for smallcases in the individual batches (buy, invest more, SIP, manage, rebalance, exit) can be found on the Orders page. If you expand a batch, you can see the quantities & prices of individual stocks.
Tracking a portfolio of stocks
When you buy a smallcase, an index value of 100 is assigned to it. Say, after a year, your index value is 124 - meaning your smallcase has returned 24%. With the index value, you don’t have to track stocks individually. There are other performance metrics available at the portfolio level to give you more detailed insights
