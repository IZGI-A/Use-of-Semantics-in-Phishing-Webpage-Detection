Did you know?

Inkie.org is a suite of self-publishing tools and resources and is available to everyone in Illinois free, without the need of a library card.
Inkie.org has three main audiences – authors, readers, and libraries.
Think Outside the Barn (TOTB) was created by a group of central Illinois librarians for the sole purpose of promoting libraries and literacy to the farmers, students, families, and agri-business leaders attending the biennial Farm Progress Show in Decatur, Illinois.
Thank you to all the libraries that sent donations, books, and volunteered for the booth.
Six EduCode Academy demos have been scheduled for IHLS members. Join them for one of several demos to find out more about EduCode and their special pricing for IHLS member libraries.
In the last several months, publishers of e-books and e-audiobooks have been changing the way they license content and imposing excessive restrictions on access to new titles. This is on top of the existing trend of library-targeted, time-limited licenses and licensing costs that can be up to six times higher than for an individual. Both the American Library Association and the Illinois Library Association list equal access to information as a core value, and ALA includes equal access to information as a core value of librarianship. While some restrictions are an expected reality, the new licensing models impose restrictions that make it far too difficult to ensure access to information for all. Limited access for libraries means limited access for library patrons, including those who count on our services the most.
The time to act is now--before the Macmillan embargo takes place and before any additional content providers adopt a similar model. Illinois Heartland Library System has developed and collected a few resources for Illinois libraries to use in advocating for libraries and patrons in Illinois and everywhere. Help in the move toward equal information access for all by learning more and by sharing these resources with your library's staff and patrons!
