It’s the time of year for spooky ghosts, creepy monsters and creative DIYs. The popularity of computerized cutters prompted Studio 300 to add the Silhouette Cameo 3. This cutter can handle card stock, chipboard, fabric and more. Feeling inspired by the season — and sheets of cute card stock — we created a Halloween village. It includes one large mansion, a few little houses, card stock trees, and fences. We also used our 3D printer to add cute pumpkins and scary monsters.
Using the Silhouette, the mansion came from a free project found at Paper Glitter Glue and converted using Adobe Illustrator. If you want to make your own, watch our video with all the steps. Studio 300 has the project files for the houses if you want to cut your own, too. And you can see the finished project in the Studio 300 display case now through Halloween.
