Digital Business Marketplace Catalyst
The world is being dominated by the digital natives – and people now expect to be able to buy and manage “anything as a service”, even on their smartphone! Digital Business Marketplace catalyst illustrates how companies in traditional industries can be digitally transformed by abstracting and digitizing their products and services, which leverage IoT, LTE/5G, Secure Device Onboarding (SDO), edge computing, AI, etc. The catalyst secures the supply chain through frictionless multi-partner Zero-Touch Orchestration (ZTO) and trading, delivering customer self-service and new revenue generating products and services.
