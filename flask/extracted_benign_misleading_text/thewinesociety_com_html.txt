That’s why our buyers spend more time getting their feet dirty in the world’s vineyards than any other merchant: they really get to know the families and winemaking teams that dedicate a lifetime of love and care to their craft. But what does that mean for you?
It means that we can vouch for every wine we sell, guaranteeing quality, provenance and absolute deliciousness. And because our buyers are free to buy only the wines they really believe in — not the ones that make the most money — you’re just as likely to enjoy an offbeat gem from the world’s far-flung corners as the favourites you know and love.
