Olexander R&D Inc. has developed proprietary coating methods and technology to uniformly and reproducibly coat neuro, coronary and peripheral stents. Coating services are provided for both device manufacturers and academic institutions for a variety of applications. Response to customer needs and requirements is paramount and we will provide services ranging from coating formulation (drug, no drug, polymer, solvent carrier) to stent crimping and sterilization. We have coating experience in processing both permanent (biostable) and biodegradable polymeric formulations on metallic and biodegradable stent substrates. We have coated a variety of stent sizes including small configurations for mouse implantation and drug testing, a “mouse stent” with a 0.635 mm diameter and an … [Read More...]
In 1993, Volkhard Lindner developed the first mouse model of vascular healing. More recently researchers ("Small is Beautiful: A Minature Stent Model") have focused on developing and validating a model of angioplasty and stenting in mice that would allow investigation of the response to stent … [Read More...]
Currently, many drug eluting stent (DES) design configurations are used in procedures called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and in research indications and experimentation. For example, the stainless steel drug eluting stent (DES) pictured above, is crimped onto a balloon catheter and … [Read More...]
For peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) or peripheral arterial disease (PA), large stent configurations are under investigation. The pictured stent above is an example of our capability to process a peripheral device. The peripheral stent is made from a biodegradable polymer matrix, 7 mm … [Read More...]
