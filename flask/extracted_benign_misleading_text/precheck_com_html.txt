Western Nevada College Nursing Program has been using PreCheck background checks for over 10 years and immunization tracking for the past couple of years. We are most appreciative of the personal service we get on the immunization tracking side of the business and the ability to customize our requirements. We also like the ease of access to the information we require and the speed with which our concerns are addressed. Overall, it has been a pleasure working with PreCheck.
The PreCheck Difference
Recognized for our personalized service, you’ll work with a dedicated account manager from day one. Because we’re healthcare-focused, our expertise means you can expect a higher level of service. Much more than a background check company, our solutions will help you streamline processes and meet compliance and accreditation standards.
