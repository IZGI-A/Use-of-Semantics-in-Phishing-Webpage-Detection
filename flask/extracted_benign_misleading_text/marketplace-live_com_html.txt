Marketplace® Simulations is a family of over 30 marketing and business simulations designed for university business courses and executive business programs. It is developed by Innovative Learning Solutions Inc, the leading publisher of online learning solutions for business students and corporate professionals worldwide.
Marketplace Simulations allow students to experiment with business strategies, test business ideas, and experience the consequences of their actions in a virtual business environment. As students apply the theoretical knowledge they learned in your class to make strategic and tactical business decisions in the game, they develop skills critical to succeed in today's business world.
The teaching methodology behind the Marketplace business games was created by Dr. Ernest Cadotte, Fisher Professor of Marketing at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
Dr. Cadotte drew on more than 30 years of his teaching experience in business and marketing, combined with the expertise of a dozen other collaborators—content experts in various areas of education—to create interactive and visually engaging business games that can be used in the classroom or in an online course.
