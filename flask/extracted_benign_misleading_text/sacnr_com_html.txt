Hello fellow Sacnarians (yes, that word is a thing now, deal with it),
We have decided to spice things up a little. And by that we mean interact with you guys more.
To do so, we have decided (in addition to Twitter) to open an Instagram account where we'll be posting all sorts of game related stuff. There you'll be able to find latest news, random game moments, promotional stuff (both image and video), the fun stuff as well as information about upcoming events.
We'll try to create as much content as we can to interact with you, our players (the old and the new) more. The main mission of this decision is to give you guys something new and attract more new players as well as bring the old ones back. We hope that our content will be interesting and will keep you guys entertained.
Come follow us! https://www.instagram.com/sacnr_

Hello
We've released some scripting updates which have allowed us to entirely remove the "weapon bug abuse" rule:
-
Weapon bug abuse
Using any bug (including GTA bugs) to speed up or skip reloading weapons.
Hopefully this will lead to fewer bans and more enjoyment of the game.
Cheers,
Blacklite

Hello
I've made some updates to how the arrest system works and included some other balance/quality of life changes:
-
Arrest logic has changed. Previously if you had 50hp and someone shot you to 40hp, they would have to shoot again to arrest. Now if you reduce someone's hp below 50, they will be arrested. So for example, if you shoot someone with 55hp and it takes them to 45hp, they will be arrested without needing an extra shot.
-
Allow players to rob banks, stores, businesses, and casinos in the active city regardless of wanted level. If you try to rob one of these locations out of the active city, you will get an error if you have a wanted level.
-
Add general robbery cooldown for casinos, banks, businesses, houses, stores. If you succeed, you can't rob another location for 5 minutes. If you fail, you must wait 90 seconds to try again.
-
UI upgrades to all robberies. Countdown timers now shown as separate text draw for consistency and readaibility.
-
You now have to evade police for 60 seconds to "complete" a robbery and pocket the money. If police come near you, it'll reset the timer to 60 seconds. The timer starts at 120 seconds if you have a duffle bag, but will reset to 60 seconds if cops are nearby and the timer is below 60 seconds. This timer is also now shown in the UI so you can see it, whereas previously it was completely hidden.
-
Increase ticket range slightly to match the arrest range (they are now the same). Previously you had to be closer to a player to ticket them than to arrest them.
-
Fixed some inconsistencies in the arrest logic which could silently change the behaviour of the arrest system.
-
Fixed a bug which meant pressing the arrest key would not work if certain other keys were held down at the same time.
-
Fixed login music. This has been broken for many years and many players probably didn't realise it was a thing.
-
Some minor grammar/text improvements.
Some of these are live already, but the rest should go live after the next server restart.
Cheers,
Blacklite

Hello
I've made some small changes to the rules, mostly to fix some formatting errors etc.
However I've also made one actual change:
Weapon bug abuse
Using any bug (including GTA bugs) to speed up or skip reloading weapons.
This includes switching weapons to avoid the animation.
As I consider switching weapons to reload not a bug but a feature :)
Cheers,

Hello SACNR,
Today we will be doing some internal changes, and attemptiong fix a couple of issues, which may cause some inconveniences in the game.
Please beware of the following unintended effects that may come up, including but not limited to:
-
We made way too many NRG-500's and Carbombs, so they'll be selling for $1 until we have a manageable amount of stock.
-
Car bombs might have a little bit too much charge in them. Please be careful when operating them!
-
Some C4 from the Carbombs spilt over San Andreas' ammunition supplies. Pretty sure we cleaned all of it off, but still beware of some residues!
-
Car manufacturers warned us about the inability to produce enough cars to place on the server, so we had to use some retired stock to fill the blanks.
-
Horn manufacturers warned us about the possibility of problems with their current products.
-
There might be some antiques under the ground. It's fine, shouldn't be able to harm us down there.
-
We have misplaced some of the helicopters in the game, so they've been replaced with other models until we find the originals. Please note these might be a bit too complicated to operate for newer players.
Please do not panic, and by all means, use these resources responsibly!
