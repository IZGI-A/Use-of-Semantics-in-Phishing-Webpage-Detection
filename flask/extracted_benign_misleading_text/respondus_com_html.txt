Who We Are
Respondus has been a pioneer of online testing applications for nearly two decades. Each year 80 million online exams use LockDown Browser to prevent cheating. Respondus Monitor is proctoring more online exams in higher education than any other proctoring system or service. Millions of exam questions are created annually with the Respondus exam authoring tool. And you’ll find Respondus technology embedded in dozens of third-party learning and assessment platforms. Yet, at the end of the day, we try to remember that education begins with one teacher and a student – and a desire to improve the world.
