We’re changing the way furniture is made, by connecting customers to local makers
Opendesk is an online marketplace that hosts independently designed furniture and connects its customers to local makers around the world. Rather than mass manufacturing and shipping worldwide, we’re building a distributed and ethical supply chain through a global maker network.
Browse and add designs to your basket or get in touch for help
Get quotes from local makers in your area within two business days
Choose the local maker’s quote that works best for you
Get furniture delivered to your door in 2-4 weeks, direct from your maker
We’ve introduced our first augmented reality experience for iPhone’s and iPad’s running iOS 12! You can now experience a virtual showroom in your own home or workplace before requesting quotes from local makers.
We spend one third of our lives working, so our work environments matter. These companies bought Opendesk designs from local makers because they’re beautiful, made on-demand and built for collaboration
