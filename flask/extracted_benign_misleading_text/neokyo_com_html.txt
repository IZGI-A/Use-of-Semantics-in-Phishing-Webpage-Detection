Overall, our customers are deeming Neokyo as Excellent.
I was able to find the figurines that I was looking for that I could not get in the American Market. Everything I have ordered has come in without fail or damage. Even the magazines that I ordered
I've made almost 30 orders on Neokyo and haven't yet had a single problem. The customer service, the easy-to-use web app, the shipping and packaging, all the purchase options, everything has been top notch from beginning to end.
Neokyo has one of the best support staff i have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. Mostly because of the direct access you have to them trough their Discord server. Making it a fast and easy support feature..
