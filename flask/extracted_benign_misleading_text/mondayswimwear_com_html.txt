Monday Swimwear understands that all bodies are unique and our mission is to create suits that celebrate all different body types and let individuality shine. That’s why we obsess about fit and don’t overlook a single detail. Click to see our fit guide and recommendations so you can find your perfect fit!
We create swimwear that's meant for you to look good, feel confident, and create amazing memories in.
Monday was founded on creating suits with iconic feminine designs, immaculate fit, soft-to-touch feel and enduring quality - all of which are our top priorities when adding any new pieces to the range.
Everything we do is with you in mind and helping you feel sexy, confident, and free!
