Men: Rising Above Stereotypes
Craig Glass encourages husbands, fathers, and sons with a much-needed reminder in today’s culture – that men matter, that they have an invaluable and God-given contribution to make to their families and society as a whole. Craig also describes how he overcame personal struggles to find his identity in Christ, all in a discussion based on his book Noble Journey: The Quest for a Lasting Legacy.
