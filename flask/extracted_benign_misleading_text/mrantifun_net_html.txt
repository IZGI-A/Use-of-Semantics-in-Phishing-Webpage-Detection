So start the game. Then on wemod find the game you want to cheat in then click on the play button in the top right corner of wemod. Then use your F1-F12 or num 1 to 9 depending on the cheats. Do not use wemod online. Use offline
I've tried what is indicated a few lines about (launch Civ 6 on Steam offline and then launch wemod) but it doesn't work. Splash screen and nothing... do I have to wait a long time on the splash screen ?
Thanks BlouDrake : I'm trying to use wemod offline because the online version is not working anymore. Was fine a few days ago but I've just got the splash screen (both online and offline). Normaly I don't have any active antivirus but it's possible Microsoft reactivated it during a recent Windows update.
Good evening guys. I have a slight problem with regards to downloading wemod. When I download wemod and run after downloading the .exe it starts to download and when download completes, it will appear that downloading failed. What should I do to fix this? Thanks for the help guys
