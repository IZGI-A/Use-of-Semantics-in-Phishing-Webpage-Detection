Our programmes of online one-to-one maths intervention and high quality resources help develop the building blocks to success in maths. Start in the autumn term for greatest impact on attainment, progress and KS2 SATs results.
Support more of your target pupils
Our one-to-one lessons take place online. Pupils share an interactive screen with their tutor and communicate via headset, so you can have up to 15 of your pupils receiving a personalised maths lesson within a single one-hour time slot.
The result? You can provide more intervention for more of your target pupils, increasing the impact on attainment and progress in maths.See it in action

Personalise teaching for each pupil
We assess all pupils online before they start their intervention programme with Third Space Learning.
This helps us, and you, to choose the most appropriate and beneficial lessons for them to work on with their tutor each week in order to consolidate or move on their learning. After their 45 minute lesson, we assess their understanding and use that to inform future tutoring lessons.Hear from our schools
