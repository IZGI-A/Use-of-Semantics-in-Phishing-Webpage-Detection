The E + M Punched Leather Pen Case is a single pen case with three decorative holes and stitched leather.
The case is quite small, measuring 135mm/5.3 inches in length, 3mm/1.2 inches in width, 2.5mm/0.1 inches in depth.
Although it is nicely made out of pliable leather, the case will not work with most fountain pens. I tried it with a Kaweco Student, which is a small pen, and it didn’t fit.
I tried it with a Kaweco Sport. With the clip, the pen didn’t fit. I had to remove the clip in order to fit the Sport in the case.
My Pelikan M101 Green Tortoise fit pretty well, although getting it in and out of the case was a bit of a hassle, and the top of the pen was slightly exposed.
I wouldn’t recommend this case for most fountain pens--only pocket-sized pens, and thin ones at that.
As for other writing instruments, the case fit my Retro Tornado perfectly:
And my Sharbo Multipen worked fine.
I thought that mechanical pencils would fit in this case, but the ones I tried (a Rotring 800 and a Platinum OLEeNU) are too long.
Unfortunately, I can’t find much use for the E + M Case since it accommodates only very small writing instruments (up to 5 inches in length but only 12mm in diameter). It does not include a clip or any means to attach it to a notebook, so it will most likely wind up at the bottom of your purse or backpack. But, if you want a simple, no frills case for a small writing utensil, it might suit you just fine.
The E + M Case is available from JetPens for $12.25.
