QR CODES
A QR Code (it stands for "Quick Response") is a mobile phone readable bar code that can store website URL's, plain text, phone numbers, email addresses and pretty much any other alphanumeric data.
The QR Stuff QR Code Generator allows you to create either dynamic or static QR codes and download them for immediate use.
Storing up to 4296 characters they are internationally standardised under ISO 18004, so a QR code is a QR code all over the world - they've been big in Japan forever, broke into Europe and the UK a few years back, and are now popular in North America.
Think "print-based hypertext links" and you'll get the idea.
