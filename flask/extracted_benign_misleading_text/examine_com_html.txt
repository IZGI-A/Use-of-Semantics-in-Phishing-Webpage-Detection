Examine.com is the most trusted resource on the internet for making intelligent decisions regarding your health. I visit it daily and frequently suggest to my patients to visit Examine.com before purchasing any supplements or making any dietary changes.
Millions of people trust Examine.com
Supplement companies misrepresent scientific research to sell you more supplements. Reviewers are often paid (overtly or not) by the same companies to pimp their products. Famous doctors and the mainstream media routinely ignore context to produce sensationalist headlines. And too many gurus, even the few who are sincere, base their recommendations on feelings rather than facts.
We were frustrated with all the misinformation.
That’s why we, in 2011, we created Examine.com. We’ve been 100% independent from the start; we’ve never sold ads or a single supplement on our website. We’ve fiercely remained independent so that we can provide unbiased and trusted information.
