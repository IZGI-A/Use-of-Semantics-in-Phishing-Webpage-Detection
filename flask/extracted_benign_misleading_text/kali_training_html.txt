The Ultimate Kali Linux Manual and Course
Whether you’re new to Information Security, or a seasoned security veteran, the Kali Linux Revealed Book and our online training exercises have something to teach you. The saying “You can’t build a great building on a weak foundation” rings true in the information security field as well, and if you use (or want to learn to use) Kali Linux in a professional capacity, you should familiarize yourself as best as you can with the internals of the penetration testing distribution. That is what this Kali Linux Revealed book is all about – turning you into a Kali Linux professional user.
Simply stated, learning how to master Kali gives you the freedom to create your own Kali Linux Recipes such as the Kali ISO of Doom, or the Evil Kali AP. After reading the Kali Linux Revealed book, you’ll be able to build optimized and custom Kali Linux kernels, host them on your own deployment repositories, or create your own custom Kali Appliances – and there’s so much more!
After completing this course, you will be able to:
- Use the Kali Linux OS proficiently.
- Automate, customize and pre-seed Kali Linux Installs.
- Create Kali appliances such as the Kali ISO of Doom.
- Build, modify and host Kali packages and repositories.
- Create, fork and modify simple Kali packages.
- Customize and rebuild your Kernel.

OK, I want in. How do I start learning?
We’re sure we’ve mentioned this before, but just in case – this is a free course provided out of courtesy, by the Kali Linux team, to the Kali community. All you need to do in order to get started is start reading the online (or PDF) version of our Kali Revealed book, and a running instance of Kali Linux. At the end of each module, the online version of the Kali book has several relevant exercises and questions. Make sure you are able to independently complete these exercises and answer the questions posed to you before you continue to the next section. Do not copy/paste the exercise answers blindly, they are version dependent. Instead, understand what you are doing, and adapt your commands to suit your environment.
What do I need to get started?
Lastly, you will need some virtualization software, preferably VMware Workstation, to safely complete the course exercises. You can download a 30-day evaluation of VMWare Workstation (Linux, Windows) or VMware Fusion (MAC OSX). Alternatively, you can try using VirtualBox, with a reduced set of features.

What is the Kali Linux Certified Professional (KLCP)?
The Kali Linux Certified Professional (KLCP) is a professional certification that testifies to ones knowledge and fluency in using the Kali Linux penetration testing distribution. KLCP holders can demonstrate an in depth understanding and utilization of the Kali Linux operating system. Individuals with this certification have the skills, knowledge and abilities to put Kali Linux to use as advanced power users, capable of creating highly customized and secure deployments. In addition, the KLCP certification provides foundational knowledge for any information security professional – allowing them to use it as a solid base in their career. The certification exam can be scheduled and purchased through VUE Testing centers around the world.
How do I prepare for the KLCP?
The body of knowledge that the KLCP relies upon can be found in the Kali Linux Revealed Book (hardcopy and online version). To prepare yourself for the KLCP certification you must read, understand and assimilate the topics and materials of the whole Kali book. The online version of this book includes additional challenges which drive through these topics via hands-on exercises – make sure to complete these exercises, while understanding exactly what you are doing, down to the individual commands. For extra assurance, familiarize yourself with the documents found in the Kali Documentation site. Once you are fluent with this material, you can consider scheduling your exam with Pearson VUE.
Examples of cool projects you can create with this knowledge
Mastering the Kali Linux distribution has many benefits, but one of the most notable is the ability to create custom tools and platforms, using Kali as a base – your imagination is the limit! For example, here are a couple of projects we published a while back which can give you a sense of the abilities of the system – The Kali ISO of DOOM, and the Kali Evil Access Point Appliances.
