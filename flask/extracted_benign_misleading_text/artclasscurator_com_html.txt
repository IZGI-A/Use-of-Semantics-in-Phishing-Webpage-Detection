TESTIMONIALS
“I was lucky to be in one of your classes this last weekend at the OAEA conference. I was surprised because I had already stumbled upon your website in the past when looking for resources. After hearing you speak and getting to experience YOUR passion for talking about art, I am inspired to do so with my students. Discussion is not my strong point so I easily talk myself out of doing it. Thank you for the starting points!”

“You are a great inspiration to me. As a first year middle school art teacher I had been struggling to include looking at and talking about art with my students. I also needed some clever, interactive ways to engage them and get them doing the thinking…not just me! Interestingly, my lower performing classes really get engaged in these (who da thunk?) and come away with some profound thoughts! It’s very gratifying to see success with them. It has helped them be more interested in the production work we are doing. It has really completed the missing link I was desperately needing! Thanks so much!”
