For just shy of 20 years, I’ve been blogging about graphic design, Adobe products and Apple in general. It started at my personal blog (originally named “CreativeGuy,” where I gained quite a nice little following. That lead to writing for other sites like CreativeBits (thanks, Ivan!), Macworld.com, TheAppleBlog, AppleLife, PCWorld, and several others. I also had the pleasure of being published in Macworld and Popular Science magazines.
TheGraphicMac was a source of creative release for me. I never did this for money. In fact, short of a few text link ads in the sidebar or footer and an occasional sponsorship banner, I never ran ads on the site. And despite being a designer for a living, I never put much effort into the design of this site either, preferring to focus on the content. I was posting articles and reviews multiple times per day for years, eventually slowing to every other day.
Since starting CreativeGuy in 1999, I’ve gotten married, moved from Las Vegas to Phoenix, and my wife and I had a son. My freelance career has done quite nicely, and my wife recently started a small business.
Because of those things, you’ve probably noticed that I haven’t posted here at the Graphic Mac on a regular basis the last few years. Not only do I no longer have the time, but I feel like The Graphic Mac has run its course, and I’m ready to retire it.
I hope you’ve found the site useful over the years! The site will cease to exist sometime in early August, but I will still be sharing free design resources and articles from other great sites both on Twitter and the GraphicMac Facebook page.
Thanks for reading, and the thousands of emails over the years. It has truly been a pleasure.
