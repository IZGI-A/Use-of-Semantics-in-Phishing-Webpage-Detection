For our Hedge Walls we create custom build concepts using a honeycomb core material that puts our product above the rest!
What is honeycomb technology?
Itâ€™s the ability to take the weight out of a structure while increasing its strength and flexibility. If that is not enough, your new structure is now water proof and rot proof while having excellent sound and vibration damping qualities. This light weight material is perfect for your next hedge wall or back drop!
