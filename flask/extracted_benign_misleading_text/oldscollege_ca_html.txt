FREE Training! This course offers a slightly different focus from the Mental Health First Aid training we have offered in the past. The course model is the EAGLE model. For many First Nations across Turtle Island (Canada), the eagle has a very prominent place and role. The eagle is most often seen as the messenger to the Creator and for this reason we use the acronym (EAGLE) to guide the process of implementing the five basic actions of providing mental health support to someone experiencing a mental health crisis or to prevent a mental crisis from worsening until professional help can be found.
