Also known as a headless CMS, an API CMS, a content platform, a disruptive content-as-a-service digital experience...basically we've built a tool that lets you choose your technology, framework, and language and then easily manage your content.
A tool built to allow your content, design, and development teams to produce a finished product that they can all be proud of.
Model custom types to match your desired design. Create reusable fields and custom components (we call them Slices...you'll hear us talk about them a lot) to enable dynamic layouts and build the editor experience that you want.
Once you've managed the initial setup, you can hand the management over to your content team so that editors can start filling content while you're choosing the framework. With Prismic, creating beautiful content becomes simple enough that even non-technical employees can handle it.
You're free to use whichever framework you prefer. Gatsby, React, Next, Vue...you can use whatever you think is best for your project, your skills, and your needs.
// Example templating with Node.js (with pug)
block body
body
div
// Render a title field
h1 !{PrismicDOM.RichText.asText(doc.title)}
// Render an image
img(src=doc.image.url)
// Render a paragraph
!= PrismicDOM.RichText.asHtml(doc.article)
Prismic uses a standard RESTful API as well as GraphQL to query and retrieve your content as a JSON response. Every Prismic repository provides an API browser that allows you to test your queries and see the results
We take care of hosting and scaling the publishing tools. All you have to do is host the website, but you can choose whichever hosting platform you prefer.
Every framework has its own properties and advantages, fast rendering, SEO, ease of deployment or progressive enhancement. Prismic integrates with every framework so that you can choose the best fit for your project
Next is a great choice if you are familiar with React but want static-site generation, server-side rendering, and Serverless deployment.
Gatsby is an extremely popular static site generator based on React. It offers a great developer experience thanks to a huge selection of plugins.
Great for SEO, Nuxt is a good choice if you're familiar with Vue and you are looking for static-site generation and server-side rendering.
Unlike a traditional CMS, an API-based approach is much simpler and more secure. This includes options for REST, GraphQL, and SDKs that help our users to make the most of Prismic.
We offer a high-level SLAs, scalability, and a global CDN. We'll make sure that everything is running smoothly in the background so that you can focus on your projects.
Built by developers for developers - we actively engage with the community. Enjoy content that is created specifically for our community and join our Slack to discuss your Prismic projects.
It's not an easy decision to make, so we've made some videos to help you choose everything from your framework to your CMS.
