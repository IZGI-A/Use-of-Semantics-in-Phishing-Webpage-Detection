Over two years ago, Cvent acquired RegOnline® (through its merger with Lanyon Solutions, Inc.), positioning Cvent to deliver world-class event management technology and customer support. Since then, we have been diligently building the best of RegOnline® into our Cvent event management platform.
We know RegOnline® is a beloved product, but we’re excited about what lies ahead. We’ve worked to incorporate these two strong solutions into one comprehensive event management product – to support events both large and small.
