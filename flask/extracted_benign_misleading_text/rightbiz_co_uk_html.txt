Started by a passionate business owner who has enjoyed buying and selling businesses. Rightbiz has become a nationwide business for sale marketplace. Every day at Rightbiz, our teams are driven by creating and growing the UK's largest business for sale network. Back in 2006, many of the business marketplaces did not have the majority of businesses in one market. Rightbiz was born with the sole aim to become an all-in-one marketplace where you can find every single business for sale in the UK.
We believe that through feedback, research and years of data, only then the perfect business for sale opportunity, new or existing, can be found.
Today, with this idea, we present Rightbiz: a marketplace spanning over 50+ sectors, boasting over Â£10 billion worth of businesses for sale, trusted by thousands of people for searching, understanding, and investing in the greatest businesses nationwide. We offer potential buyers, sellers, and agents the opportunity to benefit from the most lucrative businesses imaginable.
Rightbiz has been involved in helping the most exceptional business for sale from the largest cities in London, Birmingham, Manchester to the minutest areas in the United Kingdom. Find the right business for sale or sell a business with Rightbiz.
