Ibis frames and complete bikes are available from retailers all over the world.
For the US and Canada, head on over to the 'find a dealer' page and enter your zip code (or allow your browser to know your location) to find your closest retailer. If there's no one close, we have several options for authorized online sellers, or we are happy to sell a bike to your favorite retailer provided there's not another Ibis dealer nearby.
For international inquiries, type in the name of your country and if we have a distributor there, their name will pop up. If you don't have a distributor in your country, feel free to call us or contact us via email at askchuck@ibiscycles.com and we'll find a way for you to swing your leg over an Ibis.
Note that we do not sell our bikes directly to consumers. We sell through retailers only.
