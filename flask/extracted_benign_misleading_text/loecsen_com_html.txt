Who is this language method aimed at?
Whether you are abroad for a few days or several weeks, real contact with the locals is only possible with a little practice of their language.
That is why we have developed an internet and mobile media method to quickly learn the essentials of a language.
This course is for people who want to be independent but without going through a long learning process.
The proposed method is very simple: within each theme you first need to understand the expressions or vocabulary and then memorize them.
Then while playing with the quiz and the different ways the course can be viewed, you can train yourself to work on different language "reflexes", which will help you achieve your first automatic reactions in the language.
After this first real tangible learning phase you will find that you progress very quickly, either independently or in class.
This is what we call "finding the key"
