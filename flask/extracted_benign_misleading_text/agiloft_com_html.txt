Create Value with Contract and Commerce Management
Analyst firm Spend Matters coined the term Contract and Commerce Lifecycle management or CCLM to describe how organizations can optimize value-creating activities using contracts as the core system of commercial record.
CCLM combines advanced contract management with prebuilt modules to manage adjacent areas like GRC, source-to-pay, order-to-cash, RMA management and ITSM. A full no-code platform provides support for entirely custom processes within individual companies and vendor/customer portals integrate workflows across the entire value chain.
The result is not just cost savings and reduced cycle times, but active revenue generation. Regulatory compliance is ensured with fully auditable processes, coupled with the highest level of data security.
