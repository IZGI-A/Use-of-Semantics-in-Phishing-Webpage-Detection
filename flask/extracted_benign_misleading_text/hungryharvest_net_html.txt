Farm to doorstep produce delivery that’s good for you, good for the planet and good for your wallet.
1 in 5 fruits and veggies go to waste for the most ridiculous reasons. Too big. Too small. Don't quite look "right." We rescue this produce, curate variety boxes and deliver to your door! Every delivery helps to eliminate at least ten pounds of food from going to waste along with all the resources (water, oil, GHGs) used to grow it.
How it Works
We rescue delicious produce that would otherwise go to waste and pay farms a fair price for their harvest.
We pack variety boxes of fruits and veggies that you can customize each week to make it just right.
Our team of local drivers delivers directly to your door on a weekly or biweekly schedule.
