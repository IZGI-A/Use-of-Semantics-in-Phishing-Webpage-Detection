About OriyaMatrimony
OriyaMatrimony, a BharatMatrimony venture, has the largest number of profiles from the Odia community which makes your partner search simpler.
Odia wedding rituals begin with Kanyadaan during which the bride's father gives away the bride's hand to the groom, symbolising that henceforth the groom is expected to take care of the bride.
This is followed by Hata Ganthi Phita during which the couple's hands are tied with a string of mango leaves and they take seven rounds around the holy fire.
