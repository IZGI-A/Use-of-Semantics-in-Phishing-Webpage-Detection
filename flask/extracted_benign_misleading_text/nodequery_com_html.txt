Linux Server Monitoring
More than 12700 users are already using NodeQuery to monitor servers in over 230 cities worldwide.
Join for free today and gain insights into your servers health, availability and performance.
Quick & Easy Setup
Just one simple command is required to install and remove the agent on most of the major linux distributions. It's completely written in bash and available at Github for everyone to review.
Detailed Metrics
Our monitoring system will periodically store various system data like average load or RAM usage. Those metrics are available in high resolution for 3 days and cached up to one year.
Email Notifications
The minute your servers stop sending data or use more resources than the custom threshold you set, we will send you in-depth email notifications so you can resolve issues as fast as possible.
Public API
Our API allows you to query almost every data of your servers in our database. Use those data to create custom status pages for your customers or to feed third party dashboard applications.
About NodeQuery
NodeQuery is currently in public beta and completely free of charge. Although we are constantly improving the performance and reliability of our services, things might break from time to time. If you have any questions, suggestions or need an account upgrade to monitor more than 10 servers, please do not hesitate to contact us by email or Twitter @nodequery
