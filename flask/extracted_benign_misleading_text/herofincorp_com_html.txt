After submission of my documents, Mr. Sanjay delivered my Maestro to me within 2 hours only. He was clear abou... t the scheme and told me about every little detail like documents required, EMI, down payments, due dates, bouncing charges etc. Every month, I receive an SMS from Hero FinCorp asking me to maintain my balance in my bank account and a call from customer care 4 days before the month ends. Really it is very good for me. read more

It would be worthwhile to mention that during the current fiscal year, Hero Fincorp is the only lender on-boar... d with RGVN(NE)MFL and has consistently provided the lowest turnaround times. Although the partnership is in the initial stages, we have shared a warm relationship in our dealings with Hero FinCorp. The Relationship Manager was always on his toes, enabling us to complete the transactions at lightning speed and in a systematic manner. The term loan assistance received from HFCL definitely contributes towards the noble cause of serving the poor and needy of the Northeast India where our organization works. read more

We are very delighted to have HFCL as the financial partner, the loan structure provided by HFCL is very attra... ctive compare to any other private financers/NBFSs. After availing the facility from HFCL, we have been able to reduce our monthly obligations which in result has given us the space to plan for existing & upcoming projects.

We were very happy & surprised to see that HFCL team came to meet us on a regular basis even after disbursement (Very Rare in the industry). Team members of HFCL are also very friendly & co-operative. We will always like to be associated with HFCL. All the very best for HFCL & their team............ read more

We started our relationship journey with Hero-Fincorp since April 2015 and since then we have found no issues ... while working with them. Their quick decision making, easy and hassle free disbursements and minimal paper-work has made our work much easier. Our relation with HFCL has helped us procure additional businesses with our clients which we were unable to cater earlier due to blockage of funds. Also HFCL representative Mr. Vipul Raj Yadav has always been very helpful. We wish good luck to HFCL and hope to increase volumes with them in the near future. read more
