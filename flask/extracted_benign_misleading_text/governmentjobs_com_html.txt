Job Seeker Rights.
You can review and enforce your personal information rights through your Job Seeker account, communications you receive from us, or with the assistance of our support team.
If you apply to a job through a job board powered by us (e.g. Governmentjobs.com, Career Pages, Schooljobs.com, Agency pages) to make applying to future jobs on our Services easier, you create a universal account that persists on www.governmentjobs.com. This account will include your basic profile information. You have the right to delete this universal Governmemtjobs.com account, or any other Job Seeker account you hold, by logging in and following the deletion steps in the account settings.
You have the right to have any inaccurate personal information about you rectified. You can modify or delete personal information within your Job Seeker Profile at any time by logging in to your applicable account and following the prompts to either “update my profile” or “delete my profile.”
Our Services incorporate privacy controls which allow you to specify and limit how we process some of your personal information. For instance, to limit use of your email address, or place global limits on which Customers can preview your Job Seeker Profile, log into your account on https://www.governmentjobs.com and go to your account settings. Job Seekers can utilize similar privacy controls on a per Customer basis in each Career Page account created.
You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal information and, where we do, access to the personal information. To see whether information on you is retained on our servers, please visit click here. Certain Job Seekers are entitled to request copies of their personal information held by us.

To the extent the basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by using the privacy controls in your account settings or within certain correspondence you receive, by deleting personal information within your Job Seeker Profile, or by deleting your account. If you revoke your consent by deleting your account, your Profile information will be removed from our Job Seeker server, as well as any personal information we shared or received from our affiliated Integrators you utilized; however, revoking your consent will not remove applications you previously submit to Customers.
Upon submission of your application or making your personal information available to one of our Customers (your potential employer), your application becomes the property of the Customer. We are a data processor of Customer information in this regard, and we are not in a position to directly handle data requests for data owned by Customers. Customers may store personal information they receive from you on our servers or their own storage facilities. Customers control the types of personal information requested from you, and how long they retain this personal information. If you would like to learn what personal information Customers maintain about you, access, review, or correct that personal information, you should contact the Customer with any such inquiry. We will cooperate with such inquiry to the extent it is permitted under our confidentiality and privacy obligations.

Retention and Removal.
We retain your personal information for as long as your account is considered active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person, and enforce our agreements.
Our retention policies and procedures are designed to help ensure our compliance with legal obligations and allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. We implement retention controls Customers can utilize within the Services to control their data retention periods.
For personal information we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such information will not be kept for longer than necessary for the purpose, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request, and will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read.

Job Seekers should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.
We may retain your personal information even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, investigate security incidents, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our contractual agreements, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us. We will retain anonymized information after your account has been closed.
