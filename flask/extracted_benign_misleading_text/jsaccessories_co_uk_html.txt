A good pair of motorcycle boots can make all the difference in the event of a collision, therefore investing in a quality pair of motorbike boots is pretty essential for your safety whilst on the road.
Depending on your ride, motorcycle boots come in a range of styles with varying levels of stiffness and protection, as well as different closing mechanisms such as zips/buckles or sliders.
There is also the matter of style to consider, gone are the days when motorbike boots just came in black leather, there are biker boots for every style of rider; men's, ladies, waterproof for commuters and tourers, race boots for the track, motocross for the dirt, short boots, trainer street style boots, summer and retro boots.
We stock a vast range of motorcycle boots from all the main manufacturers.
Motorcycle gloves are probably the last piece of motorcycle gear people buy, but they should be one of the first.
If you are unfortunate to come off your bike, the first or second part of you to hit the ground is more than likely to be your hands. Motorcycle gloves are designed and built to withstand the kind of damage that motorbike accidents can cause.
As with all motorcycle protective equipment, motorbike gloves are available in a range of styles to suit what type of bike you ride and when you ride it.
Whatever your style, we have a huge range of motorcycle gloves from the biggest brands, for all seasons and all styles of bikers.
