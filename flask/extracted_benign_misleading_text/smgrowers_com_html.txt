We hope that you enjoy and find the information on the San Marcos Growers website useful. We are a wholesale plant nursery located in the eastern Goleta Valley in Santa Barbara, California. This year we celebrate forty year of growing plants appropriate to California's mediterranean climate, including many California native plants, as well as trees, vines, shrubs, perennials, ferns, succulents, ornamental grasses and grass-like plants from other areas around the world. The information on this website shares our experiences with many of these great plants.
As a wholesale nursery, we do not sell directly to the public, but we do sell to many retail nurseries and landscape professionals, as we note on our Sales Policy Page. If you would like to locate a retail nursery selling our plants, please visit our Retail Nursery Locator. Please also consult with your local retail nursery first with any questions about the plants that we list on our website.
If you are in the nursery or landscape profession, please request a password to view price information by clicking on "New User" at the top of this, or any other page. Please note that we only ship using our own trucks and only within California. Any shipping arrangements for outside of our delivery areas will need to be made by the receiver.
