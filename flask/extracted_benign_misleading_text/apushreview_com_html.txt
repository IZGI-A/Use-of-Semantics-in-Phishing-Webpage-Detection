This week is homecoming week, so I will be giving less homework to students since there are so many activities they are involved in each night. I don’t do this often, but I try to consider outside factors when something big is going on in school. The only other time I do this is the week of the musical in early March. Every year it seems that AP students are the ones that are most often involved in EVERYTHING in school.
Monday, 9/24
- Review Video #8 for the first few minutes of class
- Reading/Discussion on the Pueblo Revolt
- Connect to the Encomienda System, how was this a turning point in Spanish relations with Natives? How did the treatment of Natives by the Spanish AFTER this event differ from English relations with Natives?
- HW for tomorrow:
- Part II of Video #8 V.G.
- Video #9
Tuesday, 9/25
- Quick assessment on religion in the colonies
- This will focus on the 1stGreat Awakening, but also reviewing religious characteristics of the colonies (review from previous week)
- Reading/Discussion of “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God”
- This is actually part II of the Enhanced V.G. for video #9
- 5-10 multiple-choice question assessment. I’ll be testing next Monday on period 2, so this will give me a good idea where students are at with this time period.

Wednesday, 9/26
- Quick review of video #10 PowerPoint
- Like yesterday, we will be working on part II of the video guide in class together

- Tonight is the PowderPuff game that most of the junior class is involved with in some form
Thursday, 9/27
- Vocab quiz on Period 2
- This is the same vocab quiz they took last week, but I will make them write out the definitions this time – I will only give them the terms
- Students will analyze several documents from Period 2. They will be required to summarize the documents, and answer questions about their purpose and intended audience
- I’ll be introducing them to their first DBQ soon so they should be familiar with aspects of HIPP
- HW for tomorrow:

Friday, 9/28
