Search a [unintelligible], click on it, listen to the part you want, then correct.
GoTranscript is your solution. Since 2005, we've been producing quality transcripts, translations, subtitles, and captions. No matter what type of business you manage, our transcribing services will work for you.
When you search for transcription services online, you'll be met with many results. Combing through them can be daunting. But we'll give you a tip: If quality is a concern, always choose human generated transcription services.
Why? Because machines can't beat human ears and eyes. While speech-generated transcription may be extremely affordable, you get what you pay for. Which sometimes means spelling mistakes and embarrassing errors.
At GoTranscript, we carefully select and train all our transcribers to ensure a satisfactory experience for you. Our transcription service guarantees 99% accuracy every time, no matter how complicated the recording.
