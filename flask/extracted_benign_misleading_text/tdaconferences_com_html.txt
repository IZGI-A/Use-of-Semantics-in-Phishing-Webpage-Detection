Dear Valued Advisor,
We’ve made the difficult decision to cancel our annual LINC conference, which was set to take place in late January. Like you, we were all looking forward to being together again and we know this is disappointing news. Unfortunately, the live event environment continues to be challenging and the safety and health of our attendees is our top priority.
We have also decided not to pursue planning a large-scale virtual event. LINC is special because of its unique atmosphere and sense of community. Given our time constraints and circumstances, we felt it would be difficult to replicate that experience virtually.
Over the next few months, our teams will be taking the opportunity to evaluate our events calendar for 2021. We remain committed to delivering valuable content and professional development opportunities in a variety of channels. We’ve already shifted to more virtual events and workshops and hopefully soon we can think about how to safely bring advisors together again.
Thank you for your patience and understanding as we continue to navigate uncertainty. Stay healthy and safe.
Lauren Kimball
