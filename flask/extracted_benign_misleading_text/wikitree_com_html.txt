Member of the Week: Cari Starosta is active in our German Roots and Holocaust projects and enjoys working on unsourced and unconnected profiles. "I love the collaborative spirit on WikiTree. I love that everyone can contribute to all profiles."
Last week: Cheryl Hess. "My favorite thing about WikiTree is how close you can become to people that you have never met. By working together in G2G, or maybe working with the "Greatest Gang" [Greeters], or coordinating with other members to find sources, it really does feel like everyone is working together toward one goal."

"It's been wonderful to experience how collaborative genealogy in WikiTree makes all of us better genealogists. Collaboration on our shared ancestors encourages us to share information and to hold each other to high standards." â€” Ellen Smith
