NEW The 39 migrants, locked inside a bitterly cold and airless shipping container (centre), never stood a chance – their cries for help fading away with no one to hear them. The stowaways – 38 adults and one teenager – slowly died in ‘absolutely horrendous’ conditions after they tried to reach the UK on a cargo ferry (top) from Belgium. Experts yesterday said the temperature inside the refrigerated trailer unit might have been as low as -25C (-13F). The migrants were huddled inside for at least 15 hours by the time the door was opened on an industrial estate in Essex at 1.40am yesterday (their journey is pictured bottom left). In reality, they could have been inside their metal coffin for much longer. Although paramedics reached the scene minutes after being called out, all they found was a pile of bodies. On Tuesday night trucker Maurice ‘Mo’ Robinson (left), 25, was waiting inside his purple lorry cab at Purfleet docks for the container to be unloaded from the ship. He remained in police custody last night. Officers are trying to establish if he knew whether the migrants were inside. Officers were also pictured bowing their heads (bottom right) as forensic officers carried out details sweeps of the vehicle (centre right).
'Extremely violent' Ethiopian refugee, 32, who roamed Britain by train looking for victims to rape and attacked two women 100 miles apart after 10-hour rail journey is jailed for life
Temesgen Desta (pictured) attacked a woman in her apartment in Birmingham in March, just eight hours after he had attempted to choke and rape another woman in Crosby, Merseyside. A manhunt was launched for the Ethiopian refugee after the attacks, with police warning that Desta was travelling up and down the rail network to select his targets. Desta, who arrived in the UK in 2017, was eventually caught trying to board a ferry from western Scotland to Belfast on March 21. The Ethiopian refugee was found guilty of rape, intention to rape and two counts of false imprisonment at Birmingham Crown Court and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of ten years behind bars on Wednesday.

BREXIT: THE ENDGAME?
EU leaders line up to back a THREE-MONTH extension after MPs wreck Brexit but will it mean we get a General Election or will Jeremy Corbyn be forced by his party to back a second referendum?
French president Emmanuel Macron appeared isolated in wanting a short extension of just days past October 31 as division emerged within Angela Merkel's coalition Government. Her Social Democrat foreign minister Heiko Maas (pictured with Mrs Merkel) had suggested they would consider a Brextension of as little as two weeks. The move was seen as a boost to Boris Johnson after he was forced to request for a three-month Brexit delay at the weekend - despite wanting any delay to be much shorter. But Mr Mass was later overruled by the chancellor's spokesman Steffen Seibert, who told told reporters the extension request would 'not fail due to Germany'. Irish premier Leo Varadkar (inset) later came out in support of the push led by European Council president Donald Tusk to grant the full three-month extension. It means that a final decision on the length of the 'Brextension' may not be made until an emergency summit expected early next week.

Da Vinci was the ultimate Renaissance man. By the time of his death, aged 67, he had become an expert in countless areas: drawing, painting, sculpture, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, palaeontology and cartography.

The University of West England installed 21 en-suite 'pods' in one of the university car parks last month in order to meet increased demand (exterior right). But the units have been branded 'appalling' and 'not mentally viable' by some of the students living there, some of which have already moved out just one month in. First year students at UWE living in its Purbeck Court complex say they have been taunted by their peers for 'not living in real accommodation'. Other complaints include limited communal space (interior left), thin walls, and being overlooked by an existing hall of residence.

The celebrity 'super-emitters': Emma Watson, Paris Hilton and Oprah Winfrey are among ten stars who produce thousands of tonnes of carbon a year, finds Swedish study
Swedish academics analysed the carbon footprints of ten famous people who travel the globe (inset). Emma Watson (left), the only Briton on the list, had the tenth worst environmental impact out of the group of celebrities selected, based on their social media accounts. She flew 14 times in 2017 and travelled 42,253 miles, all on scheduled airlines, spending 71 hours in the air, the researchers calculated. Her carbon footprint from flying alone was 15.1 tons of CO2 - three times that of the global average from all activities. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates (second right) topped the list with a whopping carbon footprint of more than 1,600 tons of CO2, with Paris Hilton (second left) in a close second place with more than 1,260 tons of CO2 emitted in 2017.

Meghan opened her arms to offer a hug, but at the same time, Kate bobbed down to curtsy, resulting in her arms going around the royal's waist.

Jameela Jamil has spoken out in defense of friend Meghan Markle in the wake of the Royal's new TV documentary Harry & Meghan: An African Journey. The British-born actress praised the Duchess of Sussex for speaking up in the global fight for female equality and gender representation as well as standing up to 'bullies', in an interview with DailyMailTV. Speaking from the red carpet, the 33-year-old weighed in on the controversy surrounding the media coverage of new mom Meghan. 'I think the press in England is terrified and that's why they're trying to silence her, but she stands against bullies. And standing up to bullies is really the only way you can put them in their place,' she said. The Good Place actress, who was among the 15 women Meghan selected to be on the British Vogue cover (center) in August, gushed about being featured in the issue, calling it 'an ode to disobedient women.'

Just horsing around! Lazy steed melodramatically crumples to the ground and plays dead every time someone tries to ride him
Jingang is unrelenting in his bid to stop people from taking him for a ride around the local countryside (pictured, footage of his exploits). Every time someone tries to clamber on his saddle he crumples to the ground in a heap, sometimes leaving his hooves in the air. Footage of his amusing exploits has now emerged on Korean website Kritter Klub, showing the mischievous creature resisting every attempt by locals to ride him. One local, who appears to be trying to teach Jingang at a ranch, says: 'It's cute but naughty.' While another, in a bid to show just how cheeky the horse can be, walks towards Jingang as he's getting back up - only for the animal to play dead once more.
