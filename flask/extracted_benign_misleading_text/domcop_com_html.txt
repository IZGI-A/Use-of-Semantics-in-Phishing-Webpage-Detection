I've tried a number of expired domain finding tools and services but the support from DomCop is second to none. It's in my top two of tools to use, and the best I've used for crawling.Glen Allsopp
Let our cloud based software do the heavy lifting for you.
What DomCop does for you, is show you a list of all these domains along with important metrics for every domain. These metrics, along with our powerful filtering and sorting capabilities, will help reduce the size of the daily list from 200,000+ to just a handful of the very best domains. What would take you hours, will now literally take you seconds to do.
You can easily find domains using the best metrics available from Moz, Majestic, SEMRush, Similar Web, SEMrush, Domain Scope and Social Networks. We buy only the best, the latest, and, the most comprehensive industry wide metrics so you have the maximum amount of information to make a decision. No other tool gives you access to 90+ metrics.
DomCop supports extensive metrics from Majestic, Moz, Estibot, Alexa, SEMrush, SimilarWeb and DomainScope. The most popular metrics are Aherfs DR and Referring Domains, Majestic Trust Flow and Topical Category, Moz Domain Authority and Page Authority, Estibot domain value and SEMrush traffic data.
Check out some of the domains with decent metrics expiring shortly. This table only shows a portion of the metrics available to you. Click on the domain to see in-depth metrics for each of these.

With Domcop you get access to domains imported from domain auctions, public drop lists and our private drop lists. You can rest easy because we check whether the domains have been banned by google and whether they show up in google search, so you never end up with a useless domain.
We also check whether the domain is spammy by looking at keywords in the domain and their backlinks, and use metrics to calculate the likelihood that the backlinks are not authentic.
You can use our domains crawler that lets you scrape websites in bulk to find domains that are available to be registered and have amazing backlinks. Your personal crawlers run on our servers and are entirely web based. You do not need to install any software or have a VPS or proxies in order to do use them.
Now that is a stupidly handy tool! Certainly makes finding domains a very quick process, and I love anything that saves time!
Much love for building it!

DomCop has a great offer that all of you buying expired domains should consider. For the price of a couple domain names, you can use DomCop for a month, snag some excellent domain names, which would otherwise cost you thousands of dollars. If you're considering expired domain software and don't have the knowledge to program your own crawler, I'd lean towards DomCop.Josh MacDonald
