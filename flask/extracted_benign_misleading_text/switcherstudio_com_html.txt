Everyone has a story. Switcher makes sharing it easy.
Switcher Works with Your Devices (and fits in your pocket)
No need to buy, lug, or learn big-ass equipment. Switcher works with iPhones and iPads.

Switcher's so intuitive that anyone can create stunning video. Forget hiring outside producers or videographers.
Switcher works with your schedule
They say every minute of edited video takes one hour of editing. With live-editing, every minute takes, well, one minute.

"By using Switcher, employees are able to focus on other projects. One or two people can manage a Switcher Studio shoot versus a full 5- to 10-person team."
