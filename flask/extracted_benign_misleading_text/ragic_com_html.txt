The Ragic tool is incredible. In 4 weeks, we have completely transformed the operations of a $11MM business. We have put so much of our processes and data into Ragic!

My manager mentioned how fortunate we are to have Ragic system as our Project Management Database. He said he would hate to think where we would be today without it. It has certainly been a tremendous help to our department!

Let me say that I am blown away by your product! I can do things I never dreamed of being able to do and every hour I am learning about new and more powerful features. It seems that every time I think there is a roadblock, I find a solution that works even better than I thought.

I would like to say that I LOVE Ragic, I've easily built my own custom CRM which I'm using now competely personalized for me. Could not get this from an "off the shelf" CRM regardless of how "customizable" they claim to be.
