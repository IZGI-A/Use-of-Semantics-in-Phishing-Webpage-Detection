Pleased as punch!
I am so pleased with this mattress. I've slept better than I had in a long time. It was easy for me to unpack and manage on my own, and I love how it feels.

Great couch!
So pleased with this couch! I was worried about the back cushions, but they’ve really held up well.... even with a cat that likes to nap on them.
