Fuskator allows you to download and share galleries that contain images that are saved in a sequence.
How it works:
First Gallery Image: http://www.website.com/001.jpg
Last Gallery Image: http://www.website.com/030.jpg
Sequence: [001-030]
Fuskator URL: http://www.website.com/[001-030].jpg
Then click on Fetch!
It also works for other sequences like
http://www.website.com/image_[1-30]_large.jpg
http://www.website.com/picture_[a-z].jpg
or even for complete pages like
http://www.website.com/imagepage.html
Please post only straight content, no bestiality, no underage kids, no
extreme porn and at least 8 pics per gallery. Is it not allowed
to post content that infringes copyright.
