Welcome to Modernity Scotland
2019/20 The new website
Welcome back!
The new site is here.
This blog article explains what is happening now and throughout the year.
You can use this site for the moment but all the new content is going on the new site, which is called 'Higher Politics' for the moment but won't be once everything is transferred over.
This blog article shows you how to use the new site.
Please note that the Higher Politics content on this site has been taken down.
Follow us on social media too; Facebook and Twitter.
Never a dull moment!
