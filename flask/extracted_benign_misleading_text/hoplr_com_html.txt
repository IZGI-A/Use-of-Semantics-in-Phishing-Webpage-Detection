We have tried to bring the neighbourhood together for years using flyers, posters, events,... with little to no results. The fact that we succeeded through Hoplr proves that this neighbourhood network has a bright future in store.Erik, moderator Heiende (Lokeren)
Our neighbourhood grew quickly. What surprised me the most was the sense of solidarity among the neighbours. Hoplr really does bring people together!Kin Chi Chow, founder Heihoek (Mechelen)

What does Hoplr stand for?
1. Community first
Our communities play an essential role and that will never change. That is why, in every decision, every change and every opportunity, the added value for the neighbourhood and its residents is the first thing we consider.
2. Advertising free
We aspire to keep Hoplr advertisement-free forever. Our business model is built on useful collaborations with valuable parties. This way all messages in your neighbourhood remain relevant, interesting and above all advertisement-free!
3. Privacy by design
Protecting personal data is our biggest responsibility. Hoplr is therefore fully compliant with the European GDPR privacy legislation. We will never sell personal data.
4. Independent
Hoplr is not associated with any political or other interested party and does not have to account to any external party. We respect each person's opinion and will not express our own; neither explicitly nor implicitly.
5. Social impact
Our dream is that all Hoplr neighbours meet, help and get to know each other in real life. We believe in the power of the collective. That is why we will always organise activities and continue to give tips on social contact outside the platform.
