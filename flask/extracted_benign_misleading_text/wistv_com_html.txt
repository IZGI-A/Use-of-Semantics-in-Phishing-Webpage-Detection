A memorial service was held at the Beth Shalom Synagogue in Columbia Friday evening, in memory of the 11 victims who lost their lives at the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh nearly one year ago.
The proposals were contained in a final document approved Saturday at the end of a three-week synod on the Amazon, which Pope Francis called in 2017 to focus attention on saving the rainforest and better ministering to its indigenous people.
