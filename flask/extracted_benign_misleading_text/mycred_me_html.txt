“I’ve been very impressed with this product, and everything that it includes for free without branding! Really impressed! When I had an issue, their support team was able to log into my account and fix things on my end for me, making my life really easy!”

“I had used myCRED for a while and loved it, but on a recent project I switched to another gamefication system. I found out myCRED has been taken over by a solid dev team and now I’m back! The system is extremely well coded and has more hooks than a fisherman. I spoke with the new devs and they have big plans for this plugin, bringing it back to leader status in the world of gamification. Highly recommend.”

“I got to work with myCRED plugin when one of my clients needed to integrate it on their subscription-based website.They wanted to setup it so the customers can pay the subscription fees using their myCRED points. I must say that it was very smooth to integrate and straight forward.
My client also wanted to extend a few features of the plugin and when I developed it, development on top of this plugin was easy. Highly recommended and I’m sure gonna use it again on future projects.”
