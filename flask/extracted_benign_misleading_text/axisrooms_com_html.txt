We have been using Axisrooms Channel Manager since 2013. Our first WOW experience with the product was how easy it was to learn and use it everyday. With constant tweaks and updates the product has become a robust platform which perfectly suits the industry we work in.
We are happy and thoroughly satisfied with team Axisrooms. They have opened opportunities to grow revenue for the hotel. It is the one stop shop for revenue management and online channel distribution.
