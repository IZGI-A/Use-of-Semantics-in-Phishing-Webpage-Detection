Many people use "job" and "career" interchangeably. While it's true that each involves working and a wage, a career goes well beyond a paycheck. It’s the teacher who lesson plans at 7 a.m. for 25 rowdy second graders. It’s the nurse who spends time with the disabled veteran on her ward 30 minutes after she’s clocked out. It’s the social worker who makes sure the kids in her care have a warm meal and clean clothes at Christmastime. A career is a commitment; a career is hard work; a career is your passion. Are you ready to find yours?
