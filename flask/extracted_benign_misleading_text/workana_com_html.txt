Workana for Companies
Find out how your company can do more, in less time and at a lower cost
Thanks to Workana, we have achieved incredible short-term results without having to hire an in-house professional or invest in training.
Workana became an invaluable tool for hiring professionals in my company. Without a doubt, it is the largest freelance talent market in Latin America, and it is also in Spanish!
With Workana, I can hire several freelancers at the same time to avoid delays, and the results have been great. Iâ€™ve experienced some issues of course, but I have complete autonomy to solve them and move forward with a new professional.
Workana has facilitated the development of many projects. Without this tool, we would not have achieved in time, form and cost what we have been able to achieve.
