“When sales took off for the LuxuryLite Ultralight Cot, I had a mold made to produce the parts in high volumes. I now sell Thermarest LuxuryLite Cots around the world using cot feet designed using eMachineShop.“

“You are professionals. This was my first time using eMachineShop. I really appreciated your work. I expected my parts for the end of December, I received them three weeks before. The quotations are very precise. Thanks a lot!”

“If you want to get parts made with a CNC machine, forget about trying to learn how to use AutoCAD, FreeCAD, or SolidWorks. They are ridiculously complicated. With the free software from eMachineShop, I was able to get my first part designed and delivered in eight days! Since then, I’ve used the software to design increasingly complicated parts.”

“The eMachineShop CAD software was easy to learn/use, and the instant pricing for different options is fantastic. eMachineShop’s quote was HALF the price of the lowest local quote & indicated quicker delivery! My order came exactly when quoted & as quoted! I am very satisfied & would use them again with no reservations!”
