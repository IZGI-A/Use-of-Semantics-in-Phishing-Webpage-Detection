For nearly a decade, Communication Studies Adjunct Faculty member Meg Bucaro Wojtas has been empowering students to communicate more confidently and comfortably. She came to Elgin Community College in 2009 because, as an Elgin resident, she was well aware of the growth the college was experiencing at the time and wanted to be part of the excitement.
Michelle Knox has planted herself firmly as an administrative assistant providing clerical and administrative support for ECC’s health professions division office. However, she might be better known to people in the do-it-yourself social media realm as the monogram planter lady.
Diane Kerruish, senior executive assistant to the president, has seen her fair share of change during her eleven-year tenure at ECC. Her first experience at the college was as a student, and later she returned as the assistant to the managing director of marketing and communications. The ECC experience that truly changed her life, though, was meeting her husband while playing intramural softball!
Elgin Community College’s We Rise Gala: A Community Fundraiser for Undocumented, DACA, and Mixed Status Families will take place Friday, Nov. 15. The rescheduled Latinx Heritage Month closing event will run from 6 to 10:30 p.m. in the Jobe Lounge, Building B, 1700 Spartan Drive, Elgin.
Elgin Community College will hold an adult student information session on Wednesday, Nov. 6, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. in Building C, Room C120, 1700 Spartan Drive, Elgin. Adults who are considering returning to school or enrolling in college for the first time are encouraged to attend this free event.
At the Illinois Community College Journalism Association conference held Friday, Oct. 4, the Elgin Community College student newspaper, Observer, won second place in the John H. Ryan Best in Show competition for the May 13 issue. This annual award recognizes the best single print issues published during the spring semester among all community colleges in Illinois.
