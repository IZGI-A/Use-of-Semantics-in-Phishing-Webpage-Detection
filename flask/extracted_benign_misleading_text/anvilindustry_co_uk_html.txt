Ordered the drum and the bagpipe bits to spruce up my popular science-fantasy miniature army with a regimental band. They arrived way earlier than I expected, which I'd say is a great plus. I did have to do some modelling to get the bagpipe to fit(As specified on the product page). They fitted fine and look awesome. Didn't have any mould lines to remove either, and the bits came off from the spruce perfectly. Would very much recommend!..

Started with bodies and heads for my GW imperial guards.When I got them I must say that the pictures did not do them justice. Now after replacing heads and weapon adding on GW marine scouts Iâ€™m working on just all anvil parts to create my own designs. Everything I have ordered has been delivered quickly and in perfect condition.Cannot recommend enough. ..

Purchased a 10 man squad and a heavy weapons team (plus more pouches, backpacks, shoulder-pads and other goodies than I probably needed) to get my army started and they are by far some of the most detailed models that I have ever seen. M/F 'Plug' fittings on the arms, body and legs are a pleasure to work with and the level of care and attention that must have gone in to making each combination of parts work together is simply outstanding. I'm looking forward to ordering more awesome models in the future. ..
