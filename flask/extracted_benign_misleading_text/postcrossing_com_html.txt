What is Postcrossing?
It's a project that allows you to send postcards and receive postcards back from random people around the world. That's real postcards, not electronic! Learn more.
How does it work?
- Request an address and a Postcard ID
- Mail a postcard to that address
- Receive a postcard from another postcrosser!
- Register the Postcard ID you have received
- Go to number 1 to receive more postcards!

“It's not only a way to discover the world , it's a way to discover other people on this planet I never will meet. And it's a way to discover myself. I have received so much cards filled with love, kisses and hugs....peace is a postcard that travels the world. Thank you that I can be a part of it.....”
More love
