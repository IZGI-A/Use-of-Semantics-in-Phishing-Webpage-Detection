Free AFP Member Free Live Webinar (Oct. 21): Are Diversity and Inclusion Ethical Issues?
AFP’s Code of Ethical Principles, adopted in 1964, states that “AFP members both individual and business aspire to foster cultural diversity and pluralistic values and treat all people with dignity and respect.” What does this mean in practice today, and how is it an ethical issue? On Oct. 21, join our diverse panel of experts as they discuss how this principle is, and should be, applied in fundraising today, and what it all has to do with ethics! Webinar supported through the Claudia A. Looney Fund for Ethics in Fundraising.
