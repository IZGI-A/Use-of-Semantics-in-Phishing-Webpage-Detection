Hoi, ik ben Bart de Pau. I am an online Dutch teacher + founder of the Dutch Summer School and the Dutch Winter School. More about me here.
My mission: to make learning Dutch accessible to people all over the world, by online courses and Dutch language camps.
Learning a language should be fun. And it should be efficient. I want you to feel happy during the lesson. And I want you to feel happy afterwards because you’ve learned something. Teaching Dutch is my passion… I want to make learning Dutch your passion!
