Use Infrastructure as Code to provision and manage any cloud, infrastructure, or serviceSign up for Cloud Download CLI
Define infrastructure as code to manage the full lifecycle â€” create new resources, manage existing ones, and destroy those no longer needed.
Terraform provides an elegant user experience for operators to safely and predictably make changes to infrastructure.
Terraform makes it easy to re-use configurations for similar infrastructure, helping you avoid mistakes and save time.View All Providers
Terraform Cloud is a free to use SaaS application that provides the best workflow for writing and building infrastructure as code with Terraform.
Empower your team to rapidly review, comment, and iterate on Infrastructure as Code.

Terraform users define infrastructure in a simple, human-readable configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). Users can write unique HCL configuration files or borrow existing templates from the public module registry.
Most users will store their configuration files in a version control system (VCS) repository and connect that repository to a Terraform Cloud workspace. With that connection in place, users can borrow best practices from software engineering to version and iterate on infrastructure as code, using VCS and Terraform Cloud as a delivery pipeline for infrastructure.
When you push changes to a connected VCS repository, Terraform Cloud will automatically trigger a plan in any workspace connected to that repository. This plan can be reviewed for safety and accuracy in the Terraform UI, then it can be applied to provision the specified infrastructure.
Open Source projects benefit from the scrutiny of a broad and diverse user base. Keeping the code available helps to teach and empower the community of users, while it also provides an easy mechanism for feedback, improvement, and customization.
