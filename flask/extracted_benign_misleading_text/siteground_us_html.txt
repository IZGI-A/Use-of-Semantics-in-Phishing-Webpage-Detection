Joost de ValkYoast SEO Founder and CPO
“We keep track of which hosts we get a lot of support requests for, so we can reach out to them. We had a hard time finding SiteGround in that list as we had so few complaints from customers hosted with them.”
Ben PinesCMO, Elementor Page Builder for WordPress

“SiteGround was the first managed WordPress host I used and never looked away. I've continued to be impressed by and recommend them to everyone!”
Matt Cromwellhttps://mattcromwell.com

Managed Wordpress security & updates
Automatic WordPress Updates
Keeping your WordPress application up-to-date with the latest version is an important step in maintaining a secure site. If you find the update process difficult or simply forget to keep track of the new releases, our automatic WordPress software and plugin updates are for you. You can also schedule how fast your site is updated after a new version is released or even skip a version if you need more time to prepare for the update.
Custom Firewall Rules To Patch Vulnerabilities
We manage the overall security of your application at a server and firewall level by keeping track of WordPress-related vulnerabilities and patching against exploits. We add dozens of such rules each year and we are able to protect your sites even before the official developers release a security update.
Unmatched WordPress Performance
Unique Caching Options
WordPress instances hosted on SiteGround are amazingly fast. By default, we enable static caching for all sites on our servers, which means that certain items, like your images for example, will load faster from the memory of the server. However, the biggest impact on the WordPress loading speed is achieved by using the higher levels of our SuperCacher service and connecting your site with our NGINX-based dynamic cache and Memcached service through our SG Optimizer plugin (the option is available on our GrowBig and GoGeek plans).
Optimal PHP and HTTPS setup
You can easily set the optimal PHP version for your WordPress through our plugin and start using our HTTPS option properly with a click. Both these options ensure increased website loading speed.
Application optimizations
Automatic image optimizations, lazy image loading, GZIP compression, CSS&HTML minifications and more are also included in our SG Optimizer plugin. By adding them too, we allow our users to have an all-in-one solution, custom-built for the SiteGround hosting environment. That allows you to get the best possible performance results from a single plugin, instead of using multiple optimization plugins.
Free CDN service
We've partnered with Cloudflare to provide a free Content Delivery Network (CDN) service to our customers. The CDN tremendously speeds up your load time for visitors from different geographical locations. In order to speed up the delivery of a page, it caches its content, auto-minifies images, exploits RailGun to speed up uncacheable dynamic content, blocks malicious traffic and even reduces SPAM. The CDN network has 152 locations and growing so your page will be loaded from the one closest to your visitor!
Fast Woocommerce Launch
With our click-and-install Getting Started Wizard, you can automatically set up a WordPress instance together with the WooCommerce plugin and the professional Storefront theme. Your fully-functional online store will be ready in minutes - no technical knowledge required!
Free Woocommerce Transfer
Free WordPress Migrator
Migrating a WooCommerce website with our WordPress Migrator is easy and free.
