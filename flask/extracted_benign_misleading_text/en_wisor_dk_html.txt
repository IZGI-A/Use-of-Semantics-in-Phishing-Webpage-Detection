A successful internationalization project requires planning, high quality implementation and revision of plans.
It is essential to allocate sufficient amounts of:
Personnel Resources
Know-How
Financial Resources
for the planning and implementation phases.
However, if your company doesn’t have the experience or resources required, using the services of an outside consultant is suitable but also sensible.
The know-how, experience, contacts and resources of an expert will both speed up and facilitate the Process. To ensure a successful outcome, your company will need to collaborate with the selected expert and be actively involved in the process.
