We Design Small Buildings. We Build Small Dreams.TM
Welcome to our home celebrating our 25th year! We’ve added a NEW look and name to our business, adopting ‘Outbuildings’ to join our established name ‘Gardensheds’ to better represent the scope of work we are involved with. For short, we use the moniker GS-OB. We’re also excited to add new features and offerings to our business model. Stay tuned as we introduce more details. What has not changed is our unwavering commitment to uncompromising design, materials, craftsmanship and service.

We’ve been growing since.
