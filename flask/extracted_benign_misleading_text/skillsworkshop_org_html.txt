Welcome…
to skillsworkshop, the home of free adult literacy, numeracy and Functional Skills resources since 2001.
The site was redeveloped in 2011 and had a major upgrade on 28 September 2018. New items are added regularly and there are now more than 2000 free Functional Skills and Skills for Life resources.
The about pages describe the history of the site, the benefits of registration, and explain how you can contribute.
Using this site
The site has a powerful faceted search function: try typing something into the “Search” box at the top right of every page and then filter by author and type (resource or external link).
To look for specific curriculum topics in a given subject area use the tabs at the top of every page, such as the blue Maths tab. Then use the Maths search box (left hand side) and/or filter the resource list by level, maths topic and/or resource type.
You can see our 500+ resource contributors and follow the links to their information pages to see lists of all the resources they’ve contributed.
Latest Resources & Links is a chronological list (2018-2001) of all our items. The News page has all the latest site information and Recent Changes has details of updated site content.
