"Which language should I choose? Codecademy vs. $15,000 Bootcamps? How do I get started?" We’ve heard all your frustrations, and we’re here to help.
Both Mattan and I agree that the first month of learning to code is the hardest month. That’s why we created One Month! We’re two self-taught programmers who know the confusion that comes with getting started. And so, we’ve created all of our courses from HTML, and JavaScript, to Python with the absolute beginner in mind!
Have questions? Kindly email teachers@onemonth.com. Ask us anything. We’re here to help you get started, and to have some fun along the way.
