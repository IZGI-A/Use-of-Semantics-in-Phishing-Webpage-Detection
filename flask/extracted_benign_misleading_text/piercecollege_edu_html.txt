CBS-TV and ABC-TV news crews covered the 70th Anniversary of the Pierce College Weather Station on Oct. 16, 2019, capturing footage of President Alexis Montevirgenâ€™s introduction of the ceremony and a lively talk and demonstration of weather equipment by Geography/Meteorology Professor Jason Finley.
NBC-TV was on its way, but called to apologize that their van broke down. THATâ€™S how important our weather station â€“ and its consistent, long-running collection of data in one spot for 70 years â€“ is to the world.
â€œNot only does this station help collect data for our unique microclimate of the western San Fernando Valley, but it also helps contribute to our understanding of global climate change,â€ said Finley.
The automated online station reports detailed weather statistics in 10-minute increments, features a net radiometer, sonic wind sensor, online databases and much more. These data are used by colleges, universities, governments and private industry throughout Eurasia, Africa & the Americas.
â€œSome students aspire to be meteorologists, and the weather station helps them learn more about the weather and climate,â€ Finley explained. â€œStudents who choose meteorology as a career will get hands-on experience with weather instruments, which is useful in getting a meteorology degree.â€
Locally, the National Weather Service, LA County of Public Works, Los Angeles Fire Department, and other governmental agencies rely on the weather data from the Pierce station. Itâ€™s also used by students and community members. Students use the station to complete assignments and laboratory exercises in meteorology and physical geography classes.
Todd Hall, Senior Meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Los Angeles and Oxnard, told the group that at Pierce College, â€œFor 25,567 days someone has taken and written down a record of observations, then manually submitted that information to the National Weather Serviceâ€™s Los Angeles Office. On behalf of the National Weather Service, I extend heartfelt gratitude to Pierce College for their hard work, diligence, and effort and 25,567 thank yous for every observation that they have recorded each dayâ€¦ We look forward to 70 more years of observations.â€
