“If I had known about Mathpix earlier, perhaps I would have had enough time to work out the Grand Unified Theory.”
Albert Einstein
“When I lost my .tex file to the Principia, I was devastated. Mathpix helped me effortlessly use equations from the Principia in my new work. I now have more time to stand beneath trees and get hit by apples.”
Isaac Newton
“Mathpix's AI definitely passes this Turing test!”
Alan Turing

6 \mathrm { CO } _ { 2 } + 6 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } \rightarrow \mathrm { C } _ { 6 } \mathrm { H } _ { 12 } \mathrm { O } _ { 6 } + 6 \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }
We can also read large chunks of text that contain multiple lines. This is really helpful for when you want to extract a chunk of text from a PDF because you are unable to copy the source text directly.
