People ParkMobile
I have to give it to your company. I LOVE IT. If I need to extend my time, I do it on my iPhone, and not panic that I'm not home to add money to a machine. I just enter the zone, and it is done!!!! Also, in inclement weather, I am not out there on the street trying to figure out how much time to put on the meter... I just sit in my warm, dry car and put in the zone, the time, and I'm on my way.Barbara S.
