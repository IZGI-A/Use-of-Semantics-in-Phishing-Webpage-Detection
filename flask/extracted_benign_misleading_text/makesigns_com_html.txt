MakeSigns has specialized in printing scientific posters for over 15 years. We work with many organizations to provide presenters a very convenient, cost-effective way to have high-quality posters printed and shipped in advance of their event – or even directly to their event location ready for pick up when they arrive.
Carry your poster in style with translucent blue "ice tubes". The tubes are moisture proof and come with an adjustable nylon web shoulder strap that can clip on or off for convenience.
