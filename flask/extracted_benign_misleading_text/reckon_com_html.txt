Are you Making Tax Digital ready?
From 1 April 2019, the first phase of Making Tax Digital will go live. If your business has a taxable turnover above the VAT threshold (currently £85 000) you will need to ensure you have MTD-ready software solution in place to keep records digitally and submit VAT returns to HMRC.
We’re here to help you. We’ve added MTD functionality to Reckon One ahead of the mandatory date to ensure your business stays compliant.
