Question and Answer
Question:
Answer:
When exchanging two services between two people, there is the fundamental problem that the first person may perform their service for the second person without the second person performing their service for the first person in return. In this case, the first person is at a disadvantage without receiving the benefit of the other service in return. Because, often, the second person can enrich themself by such behavior, there is an incentive for the second person to act this way. To prevent the second person from promising a service in return but subsequently failing to act upon the promise, it is important that the first person unambiguously establishes the identity of the second person before the first person performs the first service. In this way, there is a credible threat to the second person that, with enough effort, a court decision can be obtained if the second person does not honor their part of the agreement, which would be unpleasant for the second person. Due to this threat, the probability is reduced that the second person promises a service to the first person but does not keep their promise.
