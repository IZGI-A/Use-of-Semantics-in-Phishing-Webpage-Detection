Wordsearch is the primary resource for my sermon preparation and I love it. In my experience, it is the top resource for effectively studying the word of God and efficiently getting me the information I need. If you wish to regularly dig deep into the text, I strongly suggest Wordsearch Bible.
I started using Wordsearch in 2014 and have found it to be the "Rolls Royce" of all Bible study software – especially for those who preach sermons on a weekly basis. Once you try Wordsearch, you will be amazed at the vast number of resources available for your study with just a simple click. Without reservation, I highly recommend Wordsearch to you!
