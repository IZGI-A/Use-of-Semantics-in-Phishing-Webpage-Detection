Donate Via PayPal to the Teacher and Staff Gift Fund
Last year we collected contributions for the Greeley Teacher & Staff Gift Fund during the second week of school at the same time as the general PTO contributions. However, given this most unique year, we felt it was important to hold off on this ask to allow time for our community to better understand the adjusted school experience as well as give families time to personally connect with the Greeley Teachers & Staff.
