What our customers think
“Really friendly, genuine staff who cared about the customer . It was the first time I have used your garage and I will definately be back. I've already recommended you to others. Liked the way I was shown how bad my tyres were (ashamed!) so I knew it wasn't just about an easy sale. Thankyou.”
