About
Wayne Lee, bean counter?
For a hot second, I thought I wanted to be an accountant. Lucky for me an anvil fell on my head and I found a different calling. Now after twenty years in advertising and marketing, working in both the agency and client side of the business, I've accumulated expertise in art direction and creative direction in various video, digital, traditional, and social mediums.
Here are some of the brands that I've worked on over the years:
