Marc! You are an excellent and awesome teacher! Their way of organizing the classes is incredible because it makes you put into practice all the parts of the exam and get the classes are enjoyable and the time flies by. It uses a great variety of didactic material and resources that help us to learn an infinity of new words or colloquial expressions that allow us to see the most practical part of English and apply it to our daily life. Thanks to him I have managed to reach level C1.
