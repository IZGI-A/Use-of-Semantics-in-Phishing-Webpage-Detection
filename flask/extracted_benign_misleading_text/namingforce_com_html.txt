"When I started out I just could not come up with a name I liked. I tried the Internet, and found lots of name generators but none of them were giving me what I wanted. Finally, I found Naming Force. I described my business and in no time I had a list of names to choose from. I found a name that fit my business, Sun & Chic Boutique!"
