My PPM leasing consultant, Bianca, is the best. Her hard work when I moved from Texas, site unseen, was amazing. She was the only leasing agent of numerous companies that was helpful. Every employee at PPM has been great to deal with. This is the only property management company I will ever work with in Chicago.

I absolutely LOVE living at 1049 W. Oakdale! The building is in one of the best locations and our maintenance engineer, Sejad, is incredibly helpful and responsive. Plus, PPM really cares about their residents and what we want. I literally could not have picked a better place to live when I moved to Chicago from Cleveland a few months ago!
