#SoylentForGood
At Soylent we want to make better, more affordable nutrition available to everyone. That’s why we’re helping to put an end to hunger and food insecurity. As part of our #SoylentForGood initiative, we’ve donated 1.6 million meals (and counting!) to food banks and other organizations that focus on food rescue, serving the homeless, international aid, and disaster relief.
Better for the planet.
Because we use plant-based protein, making Soylent requires less water and produces less CO2 than livestock. Our drinks reduce food waste with a year-long shelf life from manufacture and don’t require refrigeration until opened, unlike fruits and vegetables that get tossed after a few days or weeks in the fridge.
