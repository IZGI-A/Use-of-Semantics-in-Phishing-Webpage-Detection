@feedbin thanks for your good work and enhancements ... If there is one service that i cannot live without, is yours. Thans
Finally got some feeds imported in to @feedbin. This is a really nice product. ¡Viva RSS!

@feedbin I <3 you
Returning to @feedbin having not used it for a while. It is really good.
@feedbin One of my favorite web apps. Use it every day, all day. Clean & simple. Thanks for the great work.
I've enjoyed my trial with @feedbin so much, I ended up paying for service for a year. So much better!
Shoutout to @feedbin, because its web app is better than any native feed reader for OS X I have found.
RSS is amazing. There is so much good stuff in my reader. I don’t know why I’m not in there very single day. thanks @feedbin @25squares
OK @FeedBin, you've got my $3 a month. Thank you for making tagging so simple.
Apps I've recently started using daily: Feedbin, Productive, 2Do.
Stuff like this is why I’m really happy I picked @feedbin for my RSS sync service years ago. It’s gotten better every year. https://t.co/pZtFX0gYd9
@feedbin Just renewed for yet another year, and I never even considered not renewing. You’re doing a great job.
Switched from @feedly to @feedbin and now I can also read my email newsletters as RSS and filter feeds too. Awesome! @jplattel @pvantees
@feedbin Oh wow, that looks great! Switched away from Reeder because it's such a nice experience. Well done!
I reviewed @bsaid’s excellent Feedbin Notifier. So good. It’s easily my favorite Apple Watch app thus far. https://t.co/FNvcCkbqxl
We applaud how @feedbin is making their site much more private, and telling other webmasters how-to do so. "There are good private alternatives to Google Analytics out there." https://t.co/Fap9sstQtR
As long as I'm trying to sell a friend on @feedbin, allow me to sell the rest of you at a go: it's really good and I never think about it.
@feedbin Feedbin is the best web app I have ever seen! So smooth and is one of the most impressive things I have seen from a user experience perspective. Great work!
@feedbin Hi, Feedbin is great and I'm glad it exists. That's all
I love how @feedbin is still innovating new uses for RSS: https://t.co/LwlEU6Z6Kl
@feedbin Awesome. Thank you again, the service you provide is the best!
@feedbin Happy 6th Birthday to @Feedbin. Best thing ever was Google Reader closing down and letting services like this breathe and grow. Looks like a bright future too. Viva RSS.
I had no idea that @feedbin was open source. I love the service even more now.
Actually might as well remind the rest of you too: If you're still pining for the Google Reader days, just use @feedbin. It's great.
I wanted to build a service to which you could forward email newsletters and get a feed in return. Then it turned out @feedbin already does this. Hooray! 🎉
@feedbin You guys are the best, thanks for doing everything you do!
that’s my @feedbin account paid for another year. RSS ain’t dead t’me.
This service just keeps getting more awesome. I love @feedbin https://t.co/VRvKWZjUf0
@feedbin I had no idea I wanted this, but now that you’ve built it, I very much do. You’re incredible!
https://t.co/zIDl0oyfrk <--- aaahhh this is exactly what I've wanted for forever: a good GUI for browsing specifically only email newsletters. nice job @feedbin
@feedbin My renewal is coming up (as I am sure many Users are..) I would say there is zero chance of my NOT renewing; you guys are superb!
I am continually impressed by @feedbin's commitment to respecting its users while improving the service. I am a proud paying customer. https://t.co/63Msf8AmsL
@feedbin is great, cheap, and keeps adding features. I can not recommend enough #rss https://t.co/cgMDBYIj9v
Started using @feedbin yesterday and already in love. Also switched back to @instapaper and digging that, too.
@Tarendai I’ve been a @feedbin customer for 2 years, and still love it. https://t.co/c8bjkvJEHN
So pleased to see @feedbin listed at the top of https://t.co/IOlZe6PUyM . It's a fine, fine user experience (happy user for years now). It's also #opensource, which the listing doesn't mention.
@feedbin Thank you for all the work! This is one of my favorite features of Feedbin, and it's wonderful that something that I use everyday keeps getting better.
Switched back to @feedbin from my self Hosted Fever due to nice Improvements and constant Work. Keep on! :)
Slowly working my way back into RSS feeds and really pleased with @feedbin - no brainer to throw yearly subscription in there.
@feedbin I just wanted to say thanks, I use Feedbin every day and it is one of the most reliable, "just works" services I've ever used. ❤
My favorite Mac news reader is @feedbin in Safari. It’s amazingly well done. Great service too.
Happy 6th Birthday to our friends at @feedbin! 🎂 Celebrate by revisiting our conversation with @bsaid on the resurgence of RSS (can you feel it? 😉) https://t.co/C3H2tQEctQ
It's so cool to see this implementation by @feedbin for sites that don't have a favicon — https://t.co/nkAfWeaXU7
RSS wasn't dead. I've blogged about my search for a new rss-reader this weekend. Spoiler-alert: @feedbin was an easy choice. https://t.co/MpmZMTiLRA
I’ve happily payed for @feedbin since it launched. Besides the wonderful service, here is yet another example of why: https://t.co/gnmp6Wy3AZ
Feedbin (@feedbin) is beautiful software.
The best RSS reader: @feedbin . Try as I might to find anything comparable, nothing comes close. Three column layout is sweet as well :)
Still the best Google Reader successor. Love that @feedbin continually is improving. #RSS https://t.co/zEa7Sl4HMk
@feedbin Thank you for your hard work! Feedbin is so essential!
.@feedbin’s actions are probably the most underrated feature of all RSS aggregators. Simple, smart, useful. https://t.co/P6prmbMaE8
After depending on Fever for my RSS feeds for years, I am only a day into my @feedbin free trial and I’m sold. #sofast #subscribingnow
I've been a happy @Feedbin customer for years and it's exactly what this person says. It just works and stays out of the way. https://t.co/XeTpDixUmG
Setting up my @feedbin account as a forwarding address in gmail has been great. So many more things I can read in RSS now.
@feedbin Thanks for the info. And thanks for running a service that I can mostly enjoy without thinking about! \o/
As a reader, I still love blogs and RSS/Atom. I’m a happy (paying) customer of @feedbin.
Just want to compliment @feedbin - used it for years now. Always works great. Social networks are NOT an RSS replacement. Thanks y’all! 🙏
Kudos to @feedbin “Private by default” https://t.co/5pALM2K70p I’ve been a Feedbin user for years, and it’s a great RSS service with lots of neat extras, like support for email newsletters (https://t.co/T8aHLdaT0e)
Happy 6th birthday to Feedbin! Never missed Google Reader during these years. https://t.co/gaCIM2d8Pk
I have been nothing but pleased with @feedbin. If you still like RSS, try it. Simple, nicely designed, solid.
I think I'm back into RSS, after neglecting it for some time. And @feedbin is pretty cool for that.
Now that I have time for things again, I'm using @Feedbin to hold all my podcasts and RSS feeds in a more organized fashion. Great service! 👍
four years with @feedbin :D
Extended my @feedbin subscription, along with @reederapp still the best RSS reader combo you can find out there..
@feedbin This is a good example how open source can make things (and life) better. And congrats to your sixth birthday
@xzyfer I’ve been using and extremely happy with @feedbin since its inception ~ years ago
I've moved to @FeedBin as my RSS reader/syncing service. Loving the "indie" feel to it. On another note, RSS is underrated.
Another another great year of @feedbin coming my way. https://t.co/kdufbTGCkJ
Happy 2-year anniversary to @feedbin, an unassuming, extremely valuable, behind-the-scenes service that I happily pay for. 🎉
@feedbin you're the best, keep up the great work
I've been using @feedbin ever since Google Reader disappeared. A great service that keeps getting better! It's the best service for RSS!
Finally got around to moving all newsletters out of my inbox and into @feedbin. I love this feature!
@ismh My favorite RSS app is Feedbin’s website in a Fluid-powered SSB. 💖
Really liking @FeedBin. It's an extremely well-done web-based RSS reader; I love the UI and feature set. http://t.co/C08XnG5PKF
♥ Just discovered feed activity sparklines in @feedbin feeds settings. Love it! Exactly the information I needed there. ♥ #rss #ui #viz #ux
Own your news feed. @feedbin is awesome: https://t.co/usH0200vLl I'm addicted to the "Changed" view, which shows highlighted diffs on posts
** hugs @feedbin ** It's my favourite RSS aggregator by a light year. The filtering feature alone is worth the miniscule fee they charge.
We use @feedbin to monitor sites producing content about #dublin, so we can link to the best stories daily #ourcouncilday https://t.co/jtRAkmg2dx
Your irregular reminder that @feedbin is twice the RSS reader Reader ever was, highly recommended: https://t.co/CBgjlfMATe
Been using @feedbin since it came out. Continues to impress. Best Google Reader replacement for me.
I’ve just happily paid for another year (year four) subscription to @feedbin. RSS is dead, right?
Most bills I have to pay. @fastmailfm and @feedbin I like to pay.
May 2013 is around the time I started paying for @feedbin, I don’t think RSS ever died.
Every time I use @feedbin, I feel totally happy. Such a nice and well designed web app.
In general I am extremely happy with @feedbin and consider them an improvement on Google Reader. Strongly recommend using them.
@feedbin Many thanaks for your invaluable service. I've been a member since you started and you have been a reliable friend who allows me to keep my ebook news stream running without a hitch. Wish you the best in the year to come.
@feedbin 🤩😍🎆🎇 etc. Can't wait to experiment a bit with this; something I've wanted for a long time.
Also, recommend @feedbin for RSS management.
I couldn’t live without RSS! I use @feedbin to get a fine-tuned stream of blog posts. My main source of news. For me, RSS/Atom makes blogs competitive with social media. https://t.co/Djga7p46aX
BTW periodic reminder that @feedbin is a great RSS reader and also supports mailing lists: They give you a unique email that you can sign up to mailing lists with and the emails from the list will appear as if they were a feed.
Design of web UI if @feedbin is so good I don’t want to use any of the apps to view the feeds. 1-year subscription paid in a heartbeat.
@feedbin I've been looking for a good Android app but then I just added https://t.co/hj7mOhguN3 to my homescreen. Your mobile site is so good it turns out to be the"best app"! One more reason it's the perfect way to read your feed.
Probably true: "@Feedbin is the Best Way to Read Twitter" https://t.co/73V72Y9zwF 😄
This is such an awesome feature! https://t.co/akvneJrAzS
This is why I love @feedbin Beside the awesome clean and highly readable interface, I can easily get a diff on what has been changed in any article. https://t.co/te8ZammUlq
Random shout-out to some web apps I happily pay for because they're awesome: @todoist @ynab @CodePen @feedbin ❤️
Using @feedbin to view the complete archive of the @ReifyWorks blog because of course you can't actually do that on Medium dot com
Just realized I've been using (and paying for) @feedbin for 5 years. what a spectacularly simple product and excellent app.
Oooh you can listen to podcasts on @feedbin 😍😉 https://t.co/CtJnIN1My6
I already loved @feedbin before this and don’t have enough 😍😍😍 emoji on my keyboard for them after. https://t.co/Cn4QfiGiax
Happy Feedbin customer for my RSS feeds and now they’ve got an interesting take on consuming Twitter. https://t.co/qOcK0qbT6O
just paid for another year of @feedbin … it’s been a fab RSS reader since RSS was declared dead by the big G back in 2013. https://t.co/pcpHF2ub7h
@feedbin Wow, the ability for Feedbin to combine RSS and Twitter is a great feature! Two thumbs up!
Holy crap, @feedbin looks really lovely!
I've been beta-testing this and it's fantastic. between this, Feedbin's UI, nice touches like optional auto-loading of attached URLs (never click "More" again…), and their customer support, I couldn't be happier with Feedbin https://t.co/BoLXuXGfyX
Feedbin continues to rock it! https://t.co/jOu1jmAHGb
. @feedbin really is the best #rss feed manager there is, because it does so much more than manage your RSS feeds. #twitter content and #newsletters https://t.co/YlnjTMkdyO
Great! JUST GREAT! Now i’ll be spending all my time in Feedbin 👍🏽 https://t.co/NDmIlgMq4m
