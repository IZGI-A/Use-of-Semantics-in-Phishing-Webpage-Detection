What is the IELTS exam
IELTS stands for International English Language Testing System. It is an exam intended for non-native English speakers. Its purpose is to find out what your level of English is (your result is a band score from 0 to 9). Usually you need to take the IELTS test if you are applying for a job or to study in a college or university in an English-speaking country or if you are migrating to such country. There are 2 modules of the IELTS test ‚Äì Academic and General. The Academic Module is for future students and the General Module is for immigrants.
The IELTS Routine
The IELTS test consists of four parts in the following order (*)
The Listening test takes about 40 minutes ‚Äì 30 minutes to listen to a tape and to answer questions on what you hear, and 10 minutes to transfer your answers to the Answer Sheet.
The Reading test takes 1 hour and your task is to read passages of text and answer questions according to what you have read. There are also other types of assignments which I will cover later on in other posts on this website.
The Writing test also takes 1 hour and is divided into 2 sub-parts: you are given 20 minutes to write a letter/report and 40 minutes to write an essay.
The Speaking test takes up to 15 minutes and consists of 3 parts: a Personal Interview, a Cue Card talk and a Discussion.
All the parts continue one after another, and only before the Speaking test you get a break. Sometimes the Speaking test is even held on a different day.
(*) The order of IELTS sub-tests has been changed in Australia ‚Äì learn more here.
The IELTS test formalities
When it becomes clear to you that you need to take the IELTS test, you‚Äôll have to go through some formalities ‚Äì which are:
1. Call your local IELTS test centre and find out the dates when you can take an IELTS exam and how much it costs. Note: the dates could be different for the Academic and General IELTS exams.
2. Download and print the application form, fill your details, enclose your photos, a copy of identification and, of course, the money and send it to your local IELTS centre.
3. Make sure they received it and allocated a seat for you on the date you have chosen.

Hi Meesh,
I can actually recommend a good book (which I wrote especially for people to prepare in as little as 3 weeks). Have a look at Target band 7 here, you can download a free trial version and decide whether you like it or not. People are telling me it does wonders for their IELTS score.
Cheers,
Simone

I really wanted to comment on the post about the dangers of relying on internet information. As fabulous as it is (‚Äúthe world‚Äôs biggest library at our fingertips‚Äù), it‚Äôs difficult to know if some item you‚Äôve found is the current best understanding on the topic. You cant go by the copyright date at the bottom of the screen as that may be controlled by a script that auto-updates each year.

Hi I did the IELTS on 17th November and scored 7-Reading, 8.5-Listening, 8-Speaking, 8-Writing. I needed perfect 8s in all the sections. Will a re-mark improve the 7 because I‚Äôm wondering why it‚Äôs the only 7 yet reading is relatively simpler than the rest
Comment by onyangoliech ‚Äî December 8, 2011 @ 12:37 am
Sorry to tell you this, but the chance re-marking will improve the reading score is not big. Writing and Speaking are sort of subjective skills and sometimes it will help to get the work re-marked by another examiner. Reading and Listening are clerically marked, there is no examiner‚Äôs judgement involved ‚Äì the answer is ether correct or it‚Äôs not.
Comment by admin ‚Äî December 8, 2011 @ 4:23 am
Hi folks! I¬¥ve just received my academic test score. I got an overall score of 7, which I must say it¬¥s great for me. Well, thanks to all your contributions!!
CU!
Gustavo.
Comment by gustavo ‚Äî December 16, 2011 @ 5:50 am
Hello Simone,
First I would like to say thank you for this great website and the book Target Band 7. I used it intensively and my first attempt was over all-7 (7L, 7R, 7W, 7.5S), while second time improved to 7.5 (8L, 8R, 6.5W, 7.5S). As you can see, for the second time although overall score was higher, writing was reduced to 6.5 which is quite minimum. My question is which result I shall submit to university application. Even though the first result is lower, it shows evenly over 7 in all sections, which may give a better impression than having writing 6.5 even other sections resulted in better scores. Some schools require 7 in each section, so there is no question, but question remains for those requiring only overall 6.5. Thank you for your advices.
Comment by Malgretout ‚Äî December 16, 2011 @ 10:39 am
Hi Malgretout,
Congratulations on getting these excellent scores!
In regard to your question, I think you should send the score that meets the university requirements.
Some places rule out 6.5 and in that case you should send the result where you have 7+ in all skills.
Well done! Good luck with your application.
Simone

Please explain both the views and your opinion.

Hi Sajina, sorry to hear you‚Äôre nervous about the exam, but it‚Äôs completely normal ‚Äì everyone is. The best medicine to cure that feeling is to prepare well and feel in control of the exam material. If your writing isn‚Äôt good enough now to get the score you need, you can use the most recent writing topics we post daily on our website. Train to quickly come up with ideas on what to write about for each topic, and train to write according to IELTS format (read more about that here). If you need someone to check your writing, we have a team of experienced IELTS teachers to help you.

Comment by Simone Braverman ‚Äî August 8, 2018 @ 6:52 am
Hi Manpreet, without discouraging you I have to be honest, 2 weeks may not be enough to raise your score to Band 8. Reading your comment I can see some spelling and grammatical errors, Band 8 candidates need to be good at grammar and spelling. This book can help you raise your level to Band 8 ‚Äì but it will take more than 2 weeks. If you can, consider postponing your exam date to allow you to study the book first, and once you are scoring Band 8 at home reliably doing practice tests under exam conditions, you can book a real test.
Comment by Simone Braverman ‚Äî August 8, 2018 @ 7:00 am

Comment by sherin ‚Äî August 9, 2018 @ 1:16 am
Hi Sherin, IELTS is quite reliable in terms of assessing your writing. If your score is consistently low, it‚Äôs probably not because there‚Äôs something wrong with the test. Our writing correction service can help you understand what mistakes are causing your score to remain low.

Comment by Tammy1705 ‚Äî December 16, 2018 @ 6:08 pm
Hi Tammy, yes there is a chance your score can go down, just as well as go up or remain unchanged. What you can do is ask to remark only the sub-test(s) you‚Äôre not happy with (Listening, Reading, Writing or Speaking). Assuming the current scores in those sub-tests don‚Äôt help you and you‚Äôd have to retake the test if remarking doesn‚Äôt increase your score, it seems you have nothing to lose, right?

Comment by Vimmi ‚Äî January 9, 2019 @ 9:51 pm
Hi Vimmi, if you purchased your books on our website, or on Amazon, please look at the first page of any Listening test. At the top of the page there is a box with web address, that you need to type in your browser. That will take you to the page where you can download all the audio recordings for your books.

Hi Simone
I am trying to study for IELTS but my grammar isn‚Äôt better and I have not a lot of synonym words.If I want to speak or write something,I can get only one sentence to say or write.
Comment by Noreen ‚Äî January 13, 2019 @ 5:11 am
Hi Noreen, it may help if you read high-scoring IELTS essays,letters and reports that other people wrote, because you can learn new types of sentences, synonyms and expressions you can use in your own writing.

Comment by Simone Braverman ‚Äî January 22, 2019 @ 5:42 pm
I got 5.5 in writing, but want 6.5, so what I have to do?
Comment by Karan Chhotala ‚Äî February 1, 2019 @ 5:02 am
Hi Karan, I recommend that you send your writing to our teachers, to get their feedback and suggestions what you need to improve to get a higher score. Visit this page to choose a writing correction package, make a payment and start emailing your essays to our teachers. They will mark them and return to you, with feedback and an estimated IELTS score.
Comment by Simone Braverman ‚Äî February 5, 2019 @ 9:42 pm
Hi Simone,
I‚Äôve just come across your website this morning. I sit an Academic IELTS exam 10 years ago and got 6.5. This time I am aiming for an General Training IELTS score of 8.5. If I buy your book and find it unhelpful, please tell me what is the return process?
I‚Äôm very sorry if my question make you feel uncomfortable.
Thank you for your time,
Khanh
Comment by Khanh ‚Äî February 5, 2019 @ 11:23 pm
Hi Khanh, this is a totally reasonable question, and a very good one to ask! If you find that any of our books or practice tests aren‚Äôt right for you, for any reason, just email us to let us know, and your money will be refunded straight away. I must say this very rarely happens ‚Äì but in case you don‚Äôt benefit from our materials, we would never keep your money.
Comment by Simone Braverman ‚Äî February 6, 2019 @ 7:50 pm
Dear Sir,
Hope you are doing well.
I need overall 7 and 6.5 in each.
I scored 6.5 in speaking, 6 in writing, and 5 in reading and listening as well. Please let me know how to improve reading section.
Comment by Mala ‚Äî March 3, 2019 @ 6:27 am
Hi Mala, you can get better at Listening and Reading with the help of some tips to improve your performance.

Comment by Sahar jalalizadeh ‚Äî March 10, 2019 @ 5:47 am
Dear Ms. Simone,
I would like to ask which of your ebook would best suit my situation, if my interest resides in enhancing my writing skills, and overcome the 6.5 score, that I had accomplished in three successive IELTS GT attempts. My target is to reach the 7 band score, though that more than that (7.5) would be surely beneficial.
Appreciated your feedback,
Yours Sincerely,
MI
Comment by MI ‚Äî March 13, 2019 @ 1:52 pm
Hello MI, depending on the amount of time you have left to study, I recommend Ace the IELTS if you have about 3 weeks until your exam, or IELTS Success Formula if you have 6+ weeks of preparation left. ‚ÄòAce the IELTS‚Äô is more condensed and it can help you get Band 7 or 7.5, and if you‚Äôre aiming at Band 8+ then IELTS Success Formula will be a better fit, because it has lots of additional resources (vocabulary, grammar, sentence formation) that you will need to lift your score.
Comment by Simone Braverman ‚Äî March 13, 2019 @ 4:23 pm
Thanks Ms. Simone for your prompt reply.
I will consider the IELTS FORMULA ebook, as I still did not book a test schedule.
Last question, if I would like to purchase the Kindle version (Amazon) , could I download the PDF version of the file ?
Thank you,
Regards,
MI
Comment by MI ‚Äî March 14, 2019 @ 11:34 am
Hi MI, when you purchase on Amazon Kindle, you will be downloading the book in Kindle format to be read on your Kindle device or in app. When you purchase on our website, you download the book in PDF format and the audio recordings in mp3 format, and you can read the book on any computer, tablet or mobile phone.

I need to achieve band score 7.5, this is my second attempt pls how do I make my goal a reality.
Comment by Jegede modupe opeyemi ‚Äî August 24, 2019 @ 10:46 pm
If you already have your first attempt score, you know what the gap is between that, and the score that you need. You can start by looking at the skills with the biggest gap, and then dive deeper and analyse the reasons why you can‚Äôt reach the score that you need. So, for example if it‚Äôs Reading, start looking at your wrong answers and try to understand if there‚Äôs a pattern, and the reasons why you get some questions wrong. We will send you techniques how to achieve better accuracy in IELTS if you subscribe to our free daily emails here.
