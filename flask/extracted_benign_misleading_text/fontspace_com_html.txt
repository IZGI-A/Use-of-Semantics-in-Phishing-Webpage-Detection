About FontSpace
Founded in 2006, FontSpace is a designer-centered free font website that has quick customizable previews and hassle-free downloads. Every font is added and categorized by a real person. Each font is reviewed by a FontSpace moderator, checked for font quality issues, and licenses are verified. With an ever-increasing amount of unethical font websites available, we strive to be THE source for legitimate and clearly licensed free fonts. In 2019, FontSpace began to remove any fonts that had offensive designs or names so that the browsing experience is family-friendly. Whether you are a professional graphics designer, crafter, hobbyist, teacher, or student, we hope you enjoy the fonts here.
