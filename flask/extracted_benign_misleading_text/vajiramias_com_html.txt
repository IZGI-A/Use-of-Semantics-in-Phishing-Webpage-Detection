COSMIC YETI
Astronomers accidentally discovered the footprints of a monster galaxy in the early universe that has never been seen before.
About:
- Like a cosmic Yeti, the scientific community generally regarded these galaxies as folklore, given the lack of evidence of their existence, but astronomers in the United States and Australia managed to snap a picture of the beast for the first time.
- Published in the Astrophysical Journal, the discovery provides new insights into the first growing steps of some of the biggest galaxies in the universe.
- The researchers estimate that the signal came from so far away that it took 12.5 billion years to reach Earth, therefore giving us a view of the universe in its infancy.
- They think the observed emission is caused by the warm glow of dust particles heated by stars forming deep inside a young galaxy. The giant clouds of dust conceal the light of the stars themselves, rendering the galaxy completely invisible.

GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE STUDY 2017 FOR PANCREATIC CANCER
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 for pancreatic cancer was published in The Lancet.
Key findings of the study:
- Pancreatic cancer, once rare, is now a growing cause of cancer mortality worldwide. From 1,96,000 incidences in 1990, these rose to 4,41,000 in 2017.
- The burden of pancreatic cancer is higher in higher income countries. In both 1990 and 2017, the highest age-standardised death rates due to cancer were recorded in Greenland and Uruguay. On the other hand, the lowest age-standardised death rates were in Bangladesh.
- For India, the death rate due to pancreatic has increased by over five times, from 6,887 in 1990 to 30,426 in 2017, while incidence has increased from 6,824 cases to 29,059. The number of years lost due to ill-health in India were 1,826,77 in 1990 and 7,17,037 in 2017.
- Bhutan had the least incidents and deaths in the South Asian region.
Important Info :
The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach in the upper left abdomen. it has two main functions: an exocrine function that helps in digestion and an endocrine function that regulates blood sugar.

SIACHEN GLACIER
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced that the Siachen Glacier will be open for tourists, between the base camp and Kumar logistics base. As of now, civilian tourists are restricted to the Nubra Valley, which is the gateway to the Siachen Glacier, and well away from the base camp.
About:
- The Siachen Glacier is a glacier located in the eastern Karakoram range in the Himalayas, just northeast of the point NJ9842 where the Line of Control between India and Pakistan ends.
- The glacier lies between the Saltoro Ridge immediately to the west and the main Karakoram range to the east. The Saltoro Ridge originates in the north from the Sia Kangri peak on the China border in the Karakoram range.
- The entire Siachen Glacier, with all major passes, is currently under the administration of India since 1984. Pakistan controls the region west of Saltoro Ridge, far away from the glacier.
- The glacier's melting waters are the main source of the Nubra River in the Indian region of Ladakh, which drains into the Shyok River. The Shyok in turn joins the 3000 kilometre-long Indus River which flows through Pakistan. Thus, the glacier is a major source of the Indus.
- At 76 km long, it is the longest glacier in the Karakoram and second-longest in the world's non-polar areas.

SYCAMORE
Using the company's state-of-the-art quantum computer, called Sycamore, Google has claimed "quantum supremacy" over the most powerful supercomputers in the world by solving a problem considered virtually impossible for normal machines.
About:
- The quantum computer completed the complex computation in 200 seconds. That same calculation would take even the most powerful supercomputers approximastely 10,000 years to finish.
- Google's quantum computer consists of microscopic circuits of superconducting metal that entangle 53 qubits in a complex superposition state.
- Although this Google achievement is certainly a feat in the world of quantum computing, the field is still in its infancy and practical quantum computers remain far on the horizon.
Important Info :
Quantum supremacy?
- Quantum supremacy, or “quantum advantage” is the point at which quantum computers can solve problems that are practically unsolvable for “classical” (non-quantum) computers to complete in any reasonable timeframe.
- It is generally believed that at least 49 qubits are required to cross the quantum supremacy line.
- Qubits behave very differently to bits in classical computers. Bits represent either a “1” or a “0”. In contrast, qubits can represent a combination state made up of both “1” and “0,” due to the peculiar quantum effects in which properties like particle position, direction, and momentum are not well-defined.
