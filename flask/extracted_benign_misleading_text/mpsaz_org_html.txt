Average teacher salary notice per ARS 15-903(E)
$52,692 - average salary of all teachers employed in FY 2020
$50,183 - average salary of all teachers employed in FY 2019
5% increase ($2,509) from FY 2019
$46,436 - average salary of all teachers employed in FY 2018
13.5% ($6,256) increase since FY 2018
Why are we reporting a 13.5% increase to teacher pay over the past two years when teachers received a 10% increase last year and a 5% increase this year?
All returning teachers received a 10% increase in 2018-19 and a 5% increase in 2019-20. The average salary increase is 13.5% because teachers hired to replace retiring or resigning teachers often start at a lower salary, which reduces the overall percent increase calculation.
