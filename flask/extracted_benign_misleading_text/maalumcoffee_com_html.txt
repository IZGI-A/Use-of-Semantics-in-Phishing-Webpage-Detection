WHO WE ARE
Maalum Coffee was created by two friends focused on building a simple specialty coffee company while making a difference to the lives of those who deserve it the most…the farmers that grow the coffee we love.
MAALUM COFFEE CO.
Maalum Coffee Company’s initial focus is to only source green coffee from some of the smaller Eastern African countries such as Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.
Today we are locally roasting specialty coffee from Rwanda and Burundi.
Caring Through Coffee
Our direct trade practice allows us to pay our partnering farmers and farm workers more than Fair Trade minimums. We also ensure that with every bag of coffee that we sell, a portion of it goes to the various communities where these farmers and their families live. The future of coffee depends on the commitment to giving back!
