Round-Robin DNS, what is it?
Round-Robin is the easiest to understand and apply from the load balancing methods. It uses a statistical model to distribute incoming traffic to different hosts. That way, depending on the time of the DNS request, different clients will receive different DNS record that points to different hosts.
Here you can find Round-Robin example configuration!
How does it work?
Let’s say we have 3 Web servers. You have one domain, but you have 3 copies on your website in 3 different places. You can create 3 A records and use them to make a Round-Robin DNS, so the requests for your website will go to 3 different locations, depending on the time of users’ requests.
