It also depend on version. Latest on bf was probably 329? //@anonymous: Last BF, the 32GB version was $229 and 128GB was $299 (same as now). If it's just for some apps use, the 32GB is plentiful. I suggest waiting til this BF before buying. //@Anonymous: is ipad $299 a good deal? How much will it be during BF? I just need a basic one for kids to use educational app.

If they are selling "bits" but advertising it as "Bytes", it is still false advertisement. they do false advertisement no matter how you look at it, with conversion or without. Chill out.

I wish I had read about FIOS before. I can not even use my phone on WIFI around 7 to 11PM, it seems it is peak hour and my pages can not load. So I have to turn off my WIFI on my phone and use my data to cruise the net on my phone! This was my worst mistake to go with FIOS. //@Anonymous: I thought it is good deal. After I read the comments, I am glad that FIOS is not available in Houston, TX area.

Conversion factor is actually 8. So 200 mega bits = 25 mega bytes. //@Anonymous: Do you understand the difference between bit and byte? 200 mega bits = 20 mega bytes. //@Anonymous: I switched from ATT 25MBPS to fios 200MBPS, My speed test shows only 16MBPS not 200MBPS. The tech guys said we do not guarantee wireless speed! they have a lot of hidden charges as fees and equipment and etc.
My youtube freezes a lot with fios now.
Too late for me to go back, fortunately I don't have contract so I will switch to another carrier in few months.

I'm glad Verizon sold FIOS to another company in my area. Verizon is such a sleazy company. Just wait until you want to cancel your service. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the phone as you get "sent to the customer retention center" and eventually hung up on. Beside that, don't forget who sent Ajit Pai to the FCC to do their bidding in killing off net neutrality. Also don't forget who is making a killing on the other side by selling you an app to block the robocalls that they could prevent on their own side.

FIOS SUCKS

Verizon's FIOS is the biggest scam I've ever run across. They are swindlers and con-artists. If you choose to buy their service, get everything in writing before you agree to do it. They will deny what their prison-worker independent-contractor salesmen tell you on the telephone. One of their salesmen threatened me with a ten-thousand-dollar fee to get my telephone number back if I refused to sign up for the service. I suspect he's still in prison. //@Anonymous: The $79 Triply is costing me more than $130 after + taxes, equip. charges & other fees.

I installed in December as well. First I had to register for the gift card. And the gift card status is now in Processing mode. However, it says eligibility date is 4/30/19. So I am guessing I won’t get it until after that date. //@anonymous: same situation here //@Anonymous: Installed in December when they said, offer to receive $50 Amazon gift card expires if not installed by 12/31/2018. Almost 3 months and did not receive any gift card yet and their crappy website still says the gift card status as pending.

Spectrum does this too. //@Anonymous: Be aware of that Verizon will charge you installation fee. Before the installation, they will first say that they will waive your installation fee but will not tell you that the waiver can be failed and rejected by their "backend team". As the result of it, you will still be charged.
