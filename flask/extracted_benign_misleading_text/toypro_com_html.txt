Ordered the part. Got what I needed right away! Happy with using this store. I will probably use them again!!!
found what my grandson wanted and purchased. NO PROBLEMS
I was thrilled to be able to get the pieces we needed to complete a couple of sets, and delivery was prompt.
ToyPro experience was excellent. I got what I was looking for for my older sets. Will order more in future.
