Since 1960, nature's been in our DNAFjällräven began in one man’s basement and then branched out all over the world. But our original goal hasn’t changed: to inspire and enable more people to walk with nature. Follow our journey from backpacks and tents to sustainable development and events.
The Outdoor line is versatile, providing all-weather comfort while in an urban or trail setting. Fjällräven provides products to walk with you during the journey from the city to the top of the mountain.
Fjällräven offers a wide variety of equipment for all kinds of trekking, in all conditions - designed to be timeless, durable and functional.
The Mountaineering line was created to withstand variable conditions while providing solid technical support. You’ll be prepared to navigate the top of the mountain with our Bergtagen family.
