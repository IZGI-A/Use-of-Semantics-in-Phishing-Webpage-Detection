Alex Charfen | Founder and CEO of Charfen
"I did not have a good experience with virtual assistants until I found FreeeUp. Now I don't even need to think about it - I have work that needs to be done, and it gets done. No recruiting, no applications, no interviews, no complicated billing - FreeeUp does all the dirty work for you. I just get the best, most experience VA for each job. Highly recommended!"
"Our biggest bottlenecks have been our work force -- or lack thereof. Finding the right people is tough. FreeeUp made it easy for us to hire an EA when we really needed it. Nathan and his team vet the freelancers to ensure we're getting top talent to help scale our business."
Connor Gillivan & Nathan Hirsch | CMO & CEO of FreeeUp
