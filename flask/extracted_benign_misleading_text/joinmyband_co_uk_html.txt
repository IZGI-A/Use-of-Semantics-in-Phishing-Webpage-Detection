More info about this Join My Band site...
Join My Band is simply a free musicians classifieds. I'm Steve, and I launched the site in October 2006 after having difficulty finding a free, simple and effective way to find a band to join online. Since then Join My Band has grown rapidly, with thousands of musicians using the site every day, and the site now generating (as of Janaury 2013) over 2 million page views a month.
It's great hearing from members who've found themselves a band through the site, so if you have had success with Join My Band, or do so in the future, do get in touch and let me know, and if you're not a member, why not sign up and post an ad - it only takes a few minutes and it's free to do.
Thousands of drummers, guitarists, bassists, vocalists and other musicians visit Join My Band every day, so what are you waiting for? Sign up now!
Good luck!
