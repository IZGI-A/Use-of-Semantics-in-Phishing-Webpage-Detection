Fissler isn‘t only about the processing and finishing of metal; it‘s also about giving our best – since 1845. We always focus on striving for perfection. Because that‘s the only way we are able to revolutionize the world of cooking again and again – from the first aluminum pots for electric stoves to modern pressure cookers with multi level valves and even the first non-stick pans. Since its founding by Carl Phillip Fissler, we have led our company to success through continual changes, enhancements, and adaptations.
Today, Fissler is renowned worldwide as a leading manufacturer of high-quality cookware. We take pride in the knowledge that our products don‘t only make cooking a special experience, but also the subsequent dining with friends and family. In the future, we will continue to be guided by our ambition of developing products that are the best in their class – and not be satisfied with anything less.
