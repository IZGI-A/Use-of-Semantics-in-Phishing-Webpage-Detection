Graphic Designer & Photographer in Land O Lakes, Florida
HI, I'M MORGAN!
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Graphic Designer, Freelance Designer, and Photographer in the Land O Lakes / Tampa, FL area. Besides being a designer, I also wear the titles of wife, mom, and frequent flyer at Dunkin' Donuts.
I've always loved to draw, paint, and design. Growing up, I quickly got the reputation as "the creative one". I got serious about turning my passion into a job while taking design classes in high school. I started my own photography business in 2017 and began including my graphic design knowledge and skills in my own brand.
