Hubspot
Dharmesh Shah, CTO
"Culturecode.com was a natural place to unveil our own culture code. We also wanted the ability to easily share the code, and giving someone a lengthy URL or asking them to do a search on our site isn’t very convenient. On the other hand, a custom domain like culturecode.com is much easier to remember."
