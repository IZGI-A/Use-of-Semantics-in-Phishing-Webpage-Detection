Welcome to 4CDCTA! The Four Corners Dressage and Combined Training Association is a group of hunter/jumper, dressage, and eventing riders, trainers, and enthusiasts. 4CDCTA holds 5-6 local shows a year, occasionally provides excellent clinic opportunities, and allows for many opportunities for interaction and volunteerism in the horse community.
4CDCTA horse shows promote a fun and friendly atmosphere. Classes start from lead line and ground poles through 3' for hunters, and dressage classes from walk only through 4th level with western dressage classes included. Points accumulated from participation in these show classes result in year-end awards being given at a banquet and silent auction, usually held in December at the end of the show year.
If you have interests similar to those described above, whether you have a horse or are just looking to get involved in the horse community in southwest Colorado, we invite you to join us!
