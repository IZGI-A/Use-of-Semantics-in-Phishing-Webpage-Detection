LAST UPDATE : 27/09/2013
Based on the well-known original memtest86
written by Chris Brady, memtest86+ is a port by some members of the x86-secret
team, now working at www.canardpc.com. Our goal is to provide an up-to-date and completly reliable version of
this software tool aimed at memory failures detection. Memtest86+ was, is and will
always be a free, open-source software. The original Memtest86 is now handled by
PassMarkÂ® Software Pty Ltd.
Memtest86+ is released under the terms of the Gnu Public License (GPL). No restrictions for use, private or commercial exist other than the ones mentioned in the Gnu Public License (GPL). Texts about the original version was taken from the original website and written by Chris Brady.
PS : A newsletter for memtest86+ updates is available / Donation for Memtest86+ welcome. Please support free GPL software.
The first version of Memtest86+ was released on early 2004, based on memtest86 v3.0 that was not updated since mid-2002. Our main challenge was to provide an up-to-date version of this useful tool, as reliable than the original. Our work started when we got the first AMD64 system. Unfortunatly, the original memtest v3.0 didn't run at all. After looking at the source code, we fixed the bug.After some days, I saw lot of other things like chipsets or CPU that were not correctly detected or not detected at all. As I'm the chief-editor of a french hardware website (www.x86-secret.com now integrated into www.canardpc.com), I have access to lot of recent hardware and I can test and debug on quite all available motherboards on the market. After adding detection for all current CPUs, I've added detection for all current chipsets (SiS, VIA, nVidia, Intel) and ECC Polling for AMD64, i875P and E7205. Then, I decided to display some useful settings for the most popular chipsets. For exemple, on i865PE/i875P series, memtest86+ will now display FSB & Memory frequency, PAT status, memory timings, ECC status and the number of memory channels. Next version will perhaps contain several enhancements and bug-fixes.
Here is all the latest change logs for memtest86+ :

Here is some pre-compiled distributions of memtest86+. Memtest86+ comes in three different way, first is a pre-build bootable ISO, second is a bootable binary and third an installable package for creating a bootable floppy. Third version are compressed in .zip and .tar.gz.

-= Contributors of Memtest86/Memtest86+ =-
The initial versions of the source files bootsect.S, setup.S, head.S and build.c are from the Linux 1.2.1 kernel and have been heavily modified.
Doug Sisk provided code to support a console connected via a serial port.
Code to create BadRAM patterns was provided by Rick van Rein.
Screen buffer code was provided by Jani Averbach.
On-fly timings change for A64/i865/915 was provided by Eric and Wee
