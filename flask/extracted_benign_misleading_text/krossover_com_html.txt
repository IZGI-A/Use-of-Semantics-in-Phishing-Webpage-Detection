What’s Next for Hudl and Krossover
Quicker breakdowns, easier film exchanges and ongoing product enhancements are headed your way. You’ll still have access to your Krossover account until summer 2020. Until then, you can fully switch over to Hudl, stick with Krossover or spend time getting to know our tools.
Your Subscription
Everyone will be billed through Hudl.
If you renew your Krossover subscription, you'll gain access to Hudl and also have continued access to your Krossover account until summer 2020. But from here on out, all your billing will be through Hudl. So even if now isn't the right time to move your data and video, you'll still need to activate your Hudl account to pay your invoice. Set up your account now if you haven't already.
We’ll match your price.
Your invoice for this season will be a comparable Hudl offering at your Krossover pricing from the previous year, unless it’s more expensive than Hudl's pricing. In that case, you’ll receive our price.
Your invoice due date may change.
We’re working to standardize invoicing to one of the dates below:
- August 15 (fall sports)
- October 15 (winter sports)
- February 15 (spring sports)
If those dates don't work for you, we’ll work with you to find a date that’s more in line with your team’s needs.
Don’t worry about storage hours.
We won’t enforce storage limits for teams coming over from Krossover for their upcoming season. In the future, our support and customer success teams will help get your video and data into our storage model without losing anything.
Your Video and Stats
It’s easy for basketball and volleyball teams to move their video and stats.
We built a tool that allows basketball and volleyball teams to seamlessly migrate their video and stats from Krossover to Hudl with the click of a button. Just click Import from Krossover once you’re logged in to your Hudl team.
We’re working on the same tool for other sports.
If you already have Hudl and want to manually transfer your data now, you can download video from Krossover and upload it to Hudl. Or you can wait until our seamless migration tool is available for your sport. We’ll post updates here as we have them.
