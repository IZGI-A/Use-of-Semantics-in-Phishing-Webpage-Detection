At this time, the drafting tool of HearthArena is still in limited release. Please use our Reddit page
to report any problems or bugs you come across. Drafting without registering is disabled during the limited release. If have any questions or comments about HearthArena, feel free to visit /r/HearthArena
and join the conversation!
From now on we plan to share info regarding HearthArena maintenance & updates and bring you the latest Hearthstone Arena scoop via our Twitter page.
It's something that we've been wanting to do for some time now as we feel that we have a lot more to share with the community than we've been doing so far. Twitter gives us a nice and efficient way to share those important or interesting news items without the need for a full write-up like we've been doing on Reddit. This will not change our activity on Reddit but Twitter will now be the first place to check whenever we are updating the site or app.
