Best Price & Availability
After struggling with seating a Tubeless tyre, i went on the hunt for an Airshot. Leisure Lakes had them in stock and were the best price, as is usually the case. Ordered and received a couple of days later. Also ended up adding to my Tool Collection with some Awesome Park Tool products.

Specialized riprock 20
Bought this bike for my son and he absolutely loves it. Quality bike with excellent spec means my 7 year old can ride for more miles in comfort with the plus tyres too.
