Sangita Architects is an Architectural practice based out of Salt Lake, Kolkata, INDIA. Sangita Prasad started the practice in 2004 from the city of Jamshedpur subsequently branching out to Kolkata.
The practice aims to bring the core concept of architecture to the masses . A focussed approach and understanding of client requirement together with the respect for environment and economy are the sole elements creating trust for the building designs at Sangita Architects.
The design principals for our design is guided by our core values and belief:
- the most appealing design form is also the simplest with the right balance of voids and spaces.
- to zero-in practically on the pre-conception on paper needs a strong team work between the client, architects, contractors and other technicians.
- re-cycle, re-use and rennovate because we belief at every end is a new beginning.
