Whenever I'm looking for the next job, The Talent manager is always my first port of call. Easy to use, access to plenty of jobs and most recently I was offered a job at BBC Earth after applying through the website. Great stuff!

TM is great, any time my contracts have been up TM is the first place I visit and often the only place. Thanks to them, I'm now on the right career path and in a job I love. Ashley Freitas Production Co-ordinator

Pro has paid for itself several times over both with jobs I have directly applied for and tracked and as a tool that keeps me better networked and visible

As a pro member, I love seeing who has downloaded my CV, when a cover letter has been read and what else productions companies are currently working on.
Having all of my information in one place, makes it a easy place to find out about and apply for roles. Which makes the job hunting process a much less stressful experience!

I've found quite a few jobs through The Talent Manager. The best feature of the Pro Membership is that you can see when employers have read your application and downloaded your CV. It makes applying worthwhile knowing it's been acknowledged and reviewed.

The Talent Manager has been an invaluable resource. Upgrading to Pro substantially improved the amount of individuals and companies viewing my profile. Soon after upgrading, a great company contacted me via TM inviting me to attend an interview. The following week I was offered the longest contract I've had in TV so far.

I got a job via the Talent Manager which has in turn led to another contract so I can't speak highly enough of the website. It's extremely user friendly, it allows me to network with other colleagues and see their latest projects as well as the jobs board which is extremely current and updated regularly. I even recommended it to someone today asking me for advice on how to progress in the industry ... I'll certainly continue to recommend the Talent Manager to anyone looking to network within the industry. Thanks again!
