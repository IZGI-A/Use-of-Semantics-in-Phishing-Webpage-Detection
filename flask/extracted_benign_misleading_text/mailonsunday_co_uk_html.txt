The bodies were found in a lorry on the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, at roughly 1.40am this morning. It is understood the lorry was originally from Bulgaria and was travelling from Holyhead, Wales, where ferries sail to and from Ireland. The lorry's driver, a 24-year-old man from Northern Ireland, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Police have not said where they believed the people who died were from or where they were thought to be travelling to. They said it could take a long time to identify those who have died. Authorities were warned last year that people smugglers saw the Irish border as a weak point in the UK border and were taking migrants to Ireland before transporting them to Britain. It is not known whether that happened in this case.
Is Britain heading for a DECEMBER election? Jeremy Corbyn WILL back Boris Johnson's call for snap poll if EU grant a long delay - despite Labour's disastrous polls - as Downing Street goes into election mode
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is ready to back a general election despite dismal poll ratings, paving the way for a potential pre-Christmas vote. Boris Johnson (main picture) will push to go to the polls if Brussels follows Donald Tusk's advice to grant another Brexit delay, after MPs rejected the Prime Minister's three-day timetable for his Brexit bill. Mr Corbyn threw down the gauntlet to rebellious Remainers in his party who want a second referendum first, with one of his closest allies branding it 'fantasy politics' today. All eyes will now be on EU leaders amid signs of disunity over how long to extend the Brexit process, with France and Germany preferring a short extension of just weeks.

Furious mother-of-three slams elderly couple for refusing to move from the seats she reserved for her and her children on a packed train (but what would you have done?)
A furious mother-of-three has slammed an elderly couple (right) for not moving from seats she had reserved for her and her family. Amanda Mancino-Williams claimed the couple refused to move after she advised them that she had pre-booked seats on the packed train from Cheltenham to Nottingham. The 37-year-old said the couple had 'posh accents' and said her reserved tickets 'didn't matter'. Once Amanda consulted the train conductor on Tuesday afternoon she was offered four seats in first class with her children. Her children (left) were forced to cram onto three seats. After posting the images on Twitter, Amanda received praise for her handling of the situation (bottom right) with some claiming the people were miserable (right).

Sun, sea and... spamming: Dunkirk veteran Bernard Bannon, 98, lost thousands to a cynical junk mail scheme. So we tracked down the firm behind it to a Cote d'Azur HQ and confronted the owner
Earlier this year, we revealed how a 98-year-old Dunkirk veteran had lost £70,000 to ruthless post scammers before he died. Bernard Bannon, from Liverpool, (pictured with wife Rosaleen on their wedding day, inset, and right) had been bombarded with misleading letters suggesting he'd won thousands of pounds in prizes. Multi-millionaire Stéphane Alech (left) runs French company Phyderma to which the former Royal Engineer paid £4,903 in little over three years.

MEGHAN & HARRY DOCUMENTARY
Meghan Markle makes her first appearance since ITV documentary as she attends youth summit without Prince Harry - just hours after 'royal' source told US TV how the couple had 'single-handedly modernised the monarchy'
The Royal Albert Hall event in Kensington, London was Meghan's first public appearance since an explosive ITV documentary in which she revealed scrutiny and media attention had left her feeling 'vulnerable'. It also came just hours after a source close to her and Prince Harry told CNN the couple are 'single-handedly' modernising the monarchy. Meghan, 38, attended without Harry, in her role as vice-president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, which is partnering with One Young World to bring 53 young leaders to the summit. The Duchess looked in high spirits as she arrived, wearing a purple dress and sporting a broad smile as admirers rushed to get photos (pictured left).

Princess Diana (left and top right) had harnessed her fame to galvanise international action against the indiscriminate horror of landmines, and now her son was taking on the challenge. If only that had been the enduring image to be drawn from Harry and Meghan's trip to southern Africa (bottom right). Instead, the recurring theme will be their decision to vent their frustrations in a television interview at the scrutiny they feel they are suffering at the hands of the media.

JANET STREET-PORTER: Glorious Cher and indestructible Lady Glenconner don't have much in common but they could both teach Harry and Meghan a thing or two about toughening up
JANET STREET PORTER: Harry and Meghan (pictured together left) are said to be taking a six-week' break' from Royal duties after their tour of Africa. Harry seems to feel it helps to tell us how he's feeling, but there's a danger that being so open could backfire. After all, many older people (who respect the monarchy and are big fans of Harry and Meghan) just got on with their lives through wars and deprivation, through loss and heartbreak. Luckily there are oldies like Cher (top right) and Lady Anne Glenconner (bottom right) to keep our spirits up. I wonder what Cher and Anne Glenconner would make of Harry and Meghan's troubled relationship with the world at large. I am sure their advice would be the same. Just grit your teeth and get on with it, darlings. (Janet Street-Porter, pictured bottom centre)

London Paralympics gold medallist Marieke Vervoort dies through euthanasia aged 40 after battling degenerative disease that left her in agony
Belgian wheelchair sprinter Marieke Vervoort (left, in a hospital bed with her beloved dog Zenn) suffered with constant pain, seizures and paralysis in her legs, and could barely sleep. The inspirational athlete (top right during the London Paralympics in 2012, and bottom right in Doha, Qatar, in 2015) signed paperwork in 2008 that would allow a doctor to end her life in the future, in her home country where assisted dying is legal. She stunned the world in 2016 when she announced she was considering killing herself after the Rio Games, in which she won a further two medals. After, she said she did not plan to die immediately but when her 'bad days outnumber the good.' A statement from Diest - where she was from near Brussels - simply said Vervoort 'responded to her choice on Tuesday evening'. She won gold in the T52 100m wheelchair race at London 2012 and silver in the T52 200m wheelchair race. She also won medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics, claiming silver in the T51/52 400m and bronze in the T51/52 100m.

'This show makes me sooo uncomfortable': Viewers slam Gogglebox star Scarlett Moffatt's 'exploitative' new reality show that sees her Durham home recreated alongside cattle-herders in remote Namibian village
The British Tribe Next Door sees Scarlett Moffatt and her family move into an exact replica of their County Durham home in Otjeme, a remote village in Namibia, complete with running water, electricity and wardrobes full of clothes - as well as WiFi. The Moffatts are living alongside the semi-nomadic Himba tribe of cattle herders for a month in the show. However, it has been slammed on social media, with viewers criticising Channel 4 for green-lighting it. It was also branded exploitative, with one Twitter user commenting: 'What the hell are Channel 4 execs thinking?The British Tribe next door is a shockingly awful idea -reality TV at its worst. It smacks of colonialism & cultural exploitation & will probably destroy the group who took part. Utterly irresponsible.'

Woman, 40, reveals how she snared a family friend who sexually abused her when she was seven by confronting him three decades later and hiding a secret recorder in her bra
EXCLUSIVE: A woman who was sexually abused by a family friend at the age of seven has told how she confronted the paedophile 30 years later - and snared him by hiding a recorder in her bra. Sam Welch, now 40, of Crawley, West Sussex, was repeatedly attacked by Clive Manning, now 54, pictured inset, in an annex on the grounds of her family home in Kent. After keeping quiet about it for three decades, Sam (pictured left as a child and right now) bumped into Manning by chance and confronted him about the abuse he inflicted. While he didn't confess, Sam recorded their conversation on a secret device which proved enough for a case to be built against him. In January this year, Manning was convicted of 12 historic counts of indecent assault and jailed for 15 years. Bravely waiving her right to anonymity, Sam said she finally feels 'free' of her past.

TURKEY ATTACKS SYRIA
So much for a ceasefire: Syrians suffer horrific burns in border town explosion despite Turkey's claims it has stopped its offensive - as Russia says America betrayed the Kurds who will now be 'mauled' if they do not withdraw
WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT - Patients were seen with horrific burns on their faces and bodies (pictured above) at a hospital in northern Syria while a distressed young girl was carried with a badly injured leg after the mysterious blast in Ras al-Ain. Turkey said there was 'no need' to resume its operations when a five-day ceasefire ended last night. Russia today warned the Kurds would be 'mauled' if they do not withdraw from the border zone in Syria as the Kremlin savaged Washington for 'betraying' the Kurdish people. Vladimir Putin's spokesman said the 'Turkish military machine' would overpower any remaining Kurds and warned that Russian military police could not help them if they stayed in the border zone. Under a deal struck between Putin and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan yesterday, Russian forces will work with Syrian border guards to patrol the border zone.

A meeting of right minds: American conservative black commentator Candace Owens marries British Tory peer's son after whirlwind eight-month romance - with Nigel Farage as guest of honour
New details and photographs have emerged of conservative commentator Candace Owens' wedding to British Oxford graduate George Farmer at Trump Winery in Virginia, revealing the bride wore three gowns and their guests donned mock red MAGA hats that had 'Make Weddings Great Again' written on them. The 30-year-old political activist is a well-known supporter of the President, who once praised her for being 'tough' and 'someone I admire'. Her controversial views have been backed by Kanye West, who once tweeted: 'I love the way Candace Owens thinks'. Owens met Farmer in December 2018 at the launch of Turning Point UK - a conservative youth organization. She was the former communications director for the US branch. The couple were engaged over a FaceTime call just two-and-a-half weeks after meeting. They topped off their whirlwind romance with the lavish wedding over Labor Weekend in Virginia, where conservative guests included Jon Voigt, conservative radio host Larry Elder, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, bottom right, and Charlie Kirk, who founded right-wing Turning Point USA. The couple have now publicly thanked Eric Trump - the president of Trump Winery - for the 'incredible venue and. As much as Trump firebrand Owens has courted controversy since bursting onto the political scene, so has her husband. Farmer, whose father is British baron and conservative peer Lord Michael Farmer, is equally as controversial and was a candidate for the Brexit Party in Britain but didn't win a seat in the European Parliamentary elections. The couple are pictured top right with the president.

A bumper harvest of DEATH: It's a perfect year for fungi foragers... if you can dodge the killers cropping up in abundance in Britain's woodlands
Hours of autumn sunshine after months of rain means that fields and woods are full of numerous varieties of mushroom. It's the perfect weather for foraging. The golden rule with mushrooms, of course, is never to eat them unless you are completely confident that what you've found is edible. My advice, then, if you're inspired to go in search of these natural wonders is look but don't eat. For if the fungi on the right are anything to go by, pick the wrong mushroom and it could be your last.
