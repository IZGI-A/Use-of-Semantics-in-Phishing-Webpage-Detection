Suggested article from our blog: What is FQDN? What does FQDN do?
What FQDN is:
FQDN means Fully Qualified Domain Name. It is the most specified location of a computer or a host when we are talking about the DNS hierarchy.
It has all the 3 important parts â€“ the host (www.), the domain name, and the TLD (Top Level Domain).
FQDN example:
For this example, we will take the website www.quora.com. The 3 parts are easily distinguishable. www. at the beginning shows the host, quora is the name of the domain, and the .com is the TLD.
You can check the FQDN. There is a very simple way, and it works on the most popular OSes. To see how to perform the lookup, click here.
