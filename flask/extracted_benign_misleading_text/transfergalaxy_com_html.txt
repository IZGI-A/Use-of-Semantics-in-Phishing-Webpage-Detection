Empowering people regardless of borders
Over 1 billion SEK has been sent to friends and families all over the world. That's over half a million acts of care.
There are many of us
We get out grandma to the doctor when she's sick. We help a friend with his wedding or our sister with something unexpected. Together we make a difference. These are our shared stories.
