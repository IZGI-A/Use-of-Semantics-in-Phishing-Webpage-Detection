What we do. The Recurse Center is a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers in New York City.
Our philosophy. We believe people learn best when they take control of their own education and are free to explore what they’re interested in. RC is heavily influenced by unschooling.
Never graduate. RC doesn’t end after you leave. We have a diverse, active, and engaged alumni community of over 1,500 smart, enthusiastic, helpful programmers all over the world.
Build a career. We’re here to support you at every stage of your career, whether you’re looking for a new job or not, and whether you just finished RC or attended many years ago.
Hire great programmers. RC has an integrated recruiting agency. We help companies of all sizes hire our alumni. If you care about building productive, diverse teams, get in touch.

The time and space to become a better programmer is just one of the many reasons to come to RC.
