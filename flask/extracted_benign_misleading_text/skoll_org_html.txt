Social Entrepreneurs
Driving Large Scale
Change
The Skoll Foundation drives large-scale change by investing in, connecting, and celebrating social entrepreneurs and the innovators who help them solve the world’s most pressing problems.
Invest
We identify people and organizations with innovations creating scalable positive impact. We invest at their inflection point towards scale, our bet that these social entrepreneurs have charted a path to fundamentally transform unjust systems.
Connect
Social Entrepreneurship is a team sport. We believe that change agents thrive in a well cultivated community of their peers. Scalable solutions to the world’s most pressing problems require innovative partnerships.
Celebrate
We believe a story well told can change the world. Through our Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship, we have supported 122 social entrepreneurs and 100 organizations on five continents. Their stories show the world what is possible.

Thank you #SOCAP19 for bringing together indigenous leaders to explore what market-based solutions mean in a native context. Indigenous communities hold wisdom and traditions to protect the land and people that have been overlooked or ignored for far too long.
"[Social entrepreneurs] lacking some tie to the West — be it an education, a fellowship, or a co-founder — rarely get access to capital." Thanks to @devex's @AdvaSal for sharing these perspectives. It's clear there's lots of work left to be done. #SkollWF
