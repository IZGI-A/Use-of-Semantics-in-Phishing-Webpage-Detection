Whatever your expectations and desires, they all can be more than fulfilled. Bali is regularly rated one of the Top 10 tropical holiday destinations of the world. However, Bali is not straight forward. It is diverse, complex and sometimes unpredictable and fall short on your expectations if you don't know some basic rules.
The island is a vibrant, dynamic organism which is home to 4mio Indonesians and a few thousand expats living and making a living here. Bali is a "real place", with real people. Although one can find the most luxurious resorts, pristine beaches, best cuisines, and coconut trees on Bali, it is not like the Maldives or Bahamas, where everything is streamlined to the standards of global tourism and where Tourism Managers have invented concepts to provide "predictable surprises" for tourists. On Bali one can get lost in the variety of things to do.
