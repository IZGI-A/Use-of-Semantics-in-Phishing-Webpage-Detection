Dear Ben,
You have the Slug Moth Caterpillar Limacodidae correct. This is a Skiff Moth Caterpillar, Prolimacodes badia, and here is a BugGuide image for comparison. Your individual has much larger tubercles that those on most pictured specimens. According to BugGuide: “larvae feed on leaves of wide variety of trees and shrubs, including birch, blueberry, cherry, chestnut, Hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), oak, poplar, Sweetgale (Myrica gale), willow, and others” so we suppose “others” can include walnut.
