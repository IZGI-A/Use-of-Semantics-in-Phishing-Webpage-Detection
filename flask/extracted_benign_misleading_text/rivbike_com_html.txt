A tandem that's fun to ride.
We've been bucking trends with lugged steel bicycle frames, wool cycling clothes, cotton bike luggage and leather saddles ever since 1994. While the mainstream bicycle industry introduces "revolutionary" technological advances every season, we stick to what works and have flown the flags of safety, comfort and lasting value for over twenty years now. These things don't get old, even when technology does. Rivendell bikes are designed to be used hard and handed down for generations of riders. And behind the fancy paint you'll find a commitment to quality, supply-chain responsibility, and a healthy work environment for our staff.
