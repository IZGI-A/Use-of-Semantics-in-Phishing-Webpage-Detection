Anne-Elizabeth S

“I simply purchased a SIM card, registered and set up payment. The process was very straightforward. My service has been flawless.”
John E
Cincinnati, OH
“With Ting, I turn off mobile data and simply connect to Wi-Fi at work or at home. I didn’t expect that to be much of a sacrifice and it isn’t.”
Anne D

“After years of not even coming close to using up the texts, data and minutes I had on my parents’ plan, I really liked the idea of paying for what you use.”
