|Welcome
to The Dream Bible. A free online A to Z dream dictionary dedicated
to helping people understand the meaning of their dreams. Unlike
other dream interpretation websites or books we extensively research dream
symbols by interviewing people about the events occurring in their lives
at the time of their dreams. Inspired by the work of Gillian
Holloway Ph.D, we are using a database of over 350,000 dream reports to
create the world's most practical dream dictionary based on the waking
life experiences of regular people.
We hope that our work will help you to gain insight into the hidden meanings
of your dreams. Please feel free to browse the site, post
your dreams on the forum, or contact us with any of your requests.
