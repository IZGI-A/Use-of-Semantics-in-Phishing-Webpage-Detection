“Royalty-Free” is a type of license that allows the unlimited use of content for any media projects without having to pay royalty fees. All footage, templates, and motion backgrounds are royalty-free and they are yours to keep forever — even if you don’t maintain your Storyblocks subscription. Use our content to enhance your Youtube channel or social media video.

Individual plans and Business plans differ based on who the license is written to cover. A license for an individual plan is written to the individual person on the account and covers only that person. Additionally, it gives only that individual usage rights for content. Only you can use the assets you download. You can share finished projects however you like—you just can’t distribute the original stock media files. A license that covers a business provides usage rights for all your team’s seat holders. The license is written to your business, meaning that you and your business are covered with up to $1M in indemnification and truly unlimited distribution. Assets can be shared across a team, department, or even entire company—depending on the number of seats purchased. If you need our content licensed to your business, talk to our Enterprise team.
