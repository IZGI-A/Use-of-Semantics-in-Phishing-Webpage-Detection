What the heck is Hopsy?
The SUB
The Mini-Kegs
The Pour
First you need the SUB, our revolutionary plug-and-pour countertop draft system.
Choose your own or let us guide you through a rotating selection of mini-kegs of fresh beer.
Get the taproom or brewery experience delivered to the comfort of your own home.
Okay, but how does the sub work?
Load it up with a fresh mini-keg
Lock the mini-keg into place
Pour the best fresh beer

"I love it because I know nothing about beer, and they select a great range of beers for us to try out"
"The SUB has worked flawlessly...deliveries have been spot on and beer has been fresh"
"I have been a club member for 3 months now and have been VERY happy with the selection of beers"
"If you can operate a Nespresso, you can have the taproom experience at home"
"What's better than having craft beers delivered straight to your door?"
"Getting access to fresh local beer without leaving your home just got easier"

Good News! We've got fresh new batches on the way!
