Totally! In any case, before starting, we exchange about your issue and ask a few questions just to make sure we can help you. As you might know, Instagram and Facebook have strict terms and conditions that you need to know about first.
If you are not sure about your respect of their policies, you can definitely contact us!
Security and trust are paramount for our teams. For that reason, we will NEVER ask for any personal password.
To fix your problem, we will need to have a glance at your Facebook, Instagram and Shopify settings, and therefore we work with a TeamViewer software which allows us to check directly with you, from your screen.
There is normally absolutely no reason! Instagram may check from time to time if your use is still matching their terms and conditions. If, for some reason, you violate their rules, it might happen and unfortunately in this case, we cannot help.
When you get eligible thanks to our support, that means you are really and fully eligible and there is no reason to be blocked again with a normal use.
YES ! We are so convinced that we will help you, that your payment is not withdrawn before reaching functional completeness and your store is eligible for Instagram product tagging. This is how we work, and, of course, we will never charge a client if we don't meet the expectations.
We love to help our clients all over the world, and we can do it in many ways.
