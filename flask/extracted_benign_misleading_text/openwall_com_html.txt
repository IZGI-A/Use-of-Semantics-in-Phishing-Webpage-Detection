More news
Openwall software releases and other related files are also available from the
Openwall file archive and its
mirrors.
You are encouraged to use the mirrors, but be sure to verify the
signatures on software you download.
The more experienced users and software developers may use our
CVSweb server
to browse through the source code for most pieces of Openwall software
along with revision history information for each source file.
We publish articles,
make presentations, and
offer professional services.
We also maintain a
wordlists collection
for use with password crackers such as
John the Ripper
and with password recovery utilities.
Finally, we host community resources such as
mailing lists and
wiki
for users of Openwall software
and for other Open Source and computer security folks.

HPC Village
has recently been
updated
to
include an NVIDIA GTX Titan X, the largest GPU card based on NVIDIA's latest
Maxwell architecture, due to sponsorship by
Sagitta HPC
.
This is an opportunity for HPC (High Performance Computing) hobbyists
alike to program for a heterogeneous HPC platform. Participants are provided
with remote access to a server with multi-core CPUs and HPC accelerator cards
of different kinds - Intel MIC (Xeon Phi), AMD GPU, NVIDIA GPU. With the recent
update, there are two generations of GPU architectures available in the same
machine for each of AMD and NVIDIA. Some other hardware is also available in
additional machines. Eligible for HPC Village are Open Source software
developers and
ZeroNights 2015
attendees.
Please refer to the
HPC Village project web page
for a lot more detail, including for information on how to apply for an account.
