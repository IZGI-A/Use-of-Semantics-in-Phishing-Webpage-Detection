About the International Schools Database
We're here to help you make one of your most important expat parenting decisions; where to send your children to school.
The Problem
As expat parents ourselves, we know how challenging it can be to choose an international or English school for your children - especially in a new or foreign city.
First, finding all of the available schools in a foreign city is not easy. Second, the information that is readily available lacks any of the important details. And to make things even more difficult, contacting these schools to get answers to your questions is slow and frustrating.
Then when you finally settle on some potential schools, you end up spending yet more time chasing down the finer details that are relevant to you and your children.
We know it. We experienced it ourselves.
And now we want to make it easier for other expat parents out there.
The Solution
We have collected all of the important information about every international school in dozens of cities worldwide. We personally contact every school in our database to get answers to those questions that can make or break your child's experience in their new school. From fees to languages to extra-curricular activities, we've done all the research for you.
We know all too well that every family and every child is different. That's why you can personalise all of our research to your unique situation; search based on how many children you have, their ages, your preferences, and much more.
For example, you can choose the number and ages of your children, and automatically you will only see schools available for those ages (with prices adjusted accordingly). If you're only interested in a specific language or curriculum, you can search using those parameters too. Whatever you're looking for, we'll help you find it.
