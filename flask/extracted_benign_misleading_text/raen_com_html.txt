Remmy
Remmy
The Remmy is our calling card and they will never let you down. We took a note from what we know works, inspired by retro round sunglasses that captured our eye, the Remmy carries the look with a modern flare. Available in two sizes: the original 52 is a touch larger and conquers the perfectly oversized look for women, while the 49 is a slightly refined fit suited best for males. Their ultra-light construction features a slight horned temple and notched bridge.

This angular frame with it’s slightly narrow fit takes a classic silhouette and adds a modern twist. Aren’s strong lines, subtle sculpted acetate and slight nod to the 90’s makes this frame an instant classic. This frame is a must have for anyone looking for a standout- everyday pair of sunglasses.
