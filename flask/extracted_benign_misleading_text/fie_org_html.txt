When and where did you begin this sport?
She began fencing at age 11.
Why this sport?
She tried a number of sports, including dancing and taekwondo, before finding fencing. "I was interested in taekwondo and so I did it all the way until I was age 11 and I got my black belt. But then my mother still wanted me to dance and in between she made me do ice skating. I liked it, but I was not so good at it. And then my father stepped in and said, 'Why don't you try fencing?' Fencing is like the ballet of sports, it is very elegant. I really, really liked fencing so I started it at age 11."Learn more→Kazuyasu MINOBE
