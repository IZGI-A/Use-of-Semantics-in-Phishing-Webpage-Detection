Paragon Testing Enterprises, a subsidiary of The University of British Columbia (UBC), was created in 2009 to commercialize the university’s English language proficiency tests.
Paragon’s mission is to make its English language proficiency tests the tests of choice for those wishing to immigrate to Canada, become Canadian citizens, or study in Canada at all levels. To achieve this mission, Paragon conducts ongoing test research in collaboration with internationally recognized scholars at Canada’s leading universities. This test research program ensures the highest quality tests, and enables Paragon to compete with large international testing agencies.
Paragon currently administers three tests: the Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program (CELPIP) Test, the Canadian Academic English Language (CAEL)Test, and the Language Proficiency Index (LPI) Test.
The Language Proficiency Index Test is accepted by over 30 academic institutions across British Columbia and other parts of Canada. The test is also accepted by a number of professional associations, including the Victoria Police Department, the Fraser Regional Correctional Centre, the Central Saanich Police Service, and the Vancouver Island Regional Correctional Centre.
The LPI test is developed in Canada at Paragon Testing Enterprises, a subsidiary of The University of British Columbia.
Paragon has become Canada’s leading English language testing organization and is committed to developing tests that meet the highest quality standards in the field.
