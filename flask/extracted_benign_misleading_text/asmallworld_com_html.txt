ASMALLWORLD was founded in 2004 as one of the first social networks. We combined the traditions of a country club with the power of a digital platform to connect people both online and more importantly, in real life. Today, we are an essential meeting point for global citizens from all corners of the world.
To join, we require an invitation from an existing member or an application approved by our membership committee.
