The Truth About TAXI
TAXI has been so successful that dozens of companies have tried to copy what we do. Sadly, many seem more interested in making a quick buck than acting with integrity and delivering what they promise.
Other companies split submission fees with the companies that request music from them! You might wonder if they even need the music they're asking for.
