Traditional antivirus simply doesn't cut it anymore. Malwarebytes crushes the latest threats before others even recognize they exist.
Traditional antivirus fails because it’s slow to react to new threats. And, well, because it’s “dumb.” We use layers of technology like anomaly detection (a cool sort of artificial intelligence), behavior matching, and application hardening to crush malware that hasn’t even been seen before. Alright, so not really like traditional antivirus.
Our technology not only stops hackers and malware, but it cleans up an infected machine better than traditional antivirus. In fact, our technology earned the only “flawless” clean-up score from the folks at AV-TEST.org.
Visiting an infected website, accepting a call from a scammer, clicking a malicious link—these are just some of the ways you can get hacked. We shut down those attack vectors, and new ones as they pop up. The bad guys can’t even find a way in, whether you’re on Windows, Mac, or Android.
