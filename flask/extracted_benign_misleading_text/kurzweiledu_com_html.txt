When learners can't access grade-level content, they fall further behind. Features in Kurzweil 3000 enable students to access content above their proficiency level as they build their literacy skills. Their reading speed and accuracy will increase, they'll become more effective writers, and their test results will improve.
Quality text-to-speech matters, especially for persons with blindness and visual impairments. Modify Kurzweil 1000 so that listening is comfortable, and enjoyable. Then march on to independence with additional features for writing, editing, and on-to-go access.
