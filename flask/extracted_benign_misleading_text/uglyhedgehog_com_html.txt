Chimp or Not
This thought arose after reading a post on a user checking the LCD screen in bright light. Someone mentioned Chimping and I am just curious how many of you Chimp or not Chimp. Is there some sort of unwritten stigma attached to chimping that would flag you as a deplorable and not worthy of being recognized as a serious photographer or is it a useless endeavor that is just a waste of time ? Personally I like to Chimp and look at my capture; I make adjustments and move on. I fully understand the concept of " Getting it right the first time " and fully endorse that as it makes you a better photographer. Just curious as to WHY or WHY NOT you personally choose either approach. Maybe we can get a few humorous pages out of this.... Bob
Raw to ?
After opening and working on a RAW file, what do you save it as, certainly not a jpeg...
out of focus
I've been reading the Ugly H for quite some time and find it extremely helpful.
I have a Canon Rebel 3 and have had issues with pictures being out of focus. I took some of the pictures to my local camera store and he told me the issue was camera shake since nothing in the picture was in focus. Having taken pictures at 1/1000 and higher I didn't think there could be camera shake. Your thoughts? I'm looking to trade up to the Canon EOS R if this will make a big difference. Thanks.
Yosemite, a magical place on our planet
My wife and I just returned from our 40th anniversary at Yosemite, a wonderfully magical place on our planet. There is an unlimited bank of photo opportunities waiting for every photographer to tap into there. The first photo are two climbers climbing El Capitan. The second photo is a view of El Capitan at night and on the face you can see the headlamps of many climbers getting ready to spend the night on the vertical rock face which is about 3,000' high. I tried to capture the "not so typical" photos of Yosemite since it's been photographed from so many angles.

Replace Picasa with what?
I am not good at all with computers so PS/LR and so are above me but I was able to do some things in Picasa. Now that Google has stopped their support, I cannot send my pictures at all via my Gmail or Hotmail accounts. I dumped some into Google photos and not having any luck editing them or emailing them as well.
I need a good simple program that I do not have to spend days or weeks learning because of time and I only shoot occasionally.
Thanks,
Bobby
