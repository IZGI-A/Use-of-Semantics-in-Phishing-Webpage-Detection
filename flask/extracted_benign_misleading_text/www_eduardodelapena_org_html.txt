About
I am a scientific officer at the European Food Safety Authority, an agency of the EU, and guest professor at the Department of Biology of Ghent University (Belgium). I am interested in the interactions of plants with insect herbivores and their natural enemies. I also study how soil organisms affect plant growth, defensive traits, and aboveground plant-insect interactions. I have applied this research framework in different natural and agroecosystems. At a different scale of organization, I am interested in understanding how landscape features determine the functional biodiversity and productivity of agroecosystems.
