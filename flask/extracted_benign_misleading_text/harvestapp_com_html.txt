A brief history of time (tracking).
The seed is planted
After a futile search for a time tracking tool that wasn’t miserable to use, web designers Shawn Liu and Danny Wen took a stab at creating one of their own. Harvest was born.
Going mobile
Apple revolutionized technology with the release of the iPhone in 2007. Harvest was hot on their heels with a mobile experience that liberated time trackers from their desktops.
Walkabout
We’re a curious bunch here at Harvest. That’s why we organized Walkabout: a chance for other curious people to tour the offices of NYC’s tech companies.
From Flatiron with love
We outgrew our snug Soho headquarters and moved down the street from the Flatiron building. Most days it’s pretty quiet, but it fills up twice a year for Harvest summits.
Back to the future
Ever wish you could hop in a DeLorean and go back to the beginning of a project so you can get it right? We created team planning app Forecast so you don’t have to.
The Harvest team hits fifty
Only ten years ago Harvest was a humble team of three. It’s hard to believe there are now fifty Harvesters spread across the globe from Lithuania to Los Angeles.
Giving back
We’re proud to make quality products, but we think we can do a little more for the world too. That’s why Harvest has committed to donating 4% of its profits to charity.

As Special Project Coordinator Katie is the office jack-of-all-trades, and we all enjoy her cooking and gardening skills. She’s also a huge Stevie Wonder fan and is responsible for the wonderful addition of Songs in the Key of Life to the Harvest HQ record collection.
Originally from Barcelona, Julia’s now a full-fledged digital nomad. In the last year she’s visited Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, NYC, SF, Portland, LA, Barcelona, Stockholm, Berlin, Edinburgh, and Colombia, working from coffee shops, hostels, coworking spaces, planes, and even a minibus.
When Karla isn’t putting feature updates through their paces as a member of the QA team, she can be found taking care of her pastel ball python Monet Emile, named after pastel artist Claude Monet and actor Emile Hirsch.
Matthew is Harvest’s resident karaoke MC, and has helped lead Forecast from just an idea to a fully fledged product used by over three thousand companies.
Even though Alanna normally works to support our support team from Harvest HQ, she recently hit the road for her honeymoon. She and her husband drove from Brooklyn to the West Coast and over six months she worked remotely from five cities (and visited thirteen national parks).
One of the developers behind our Slack integration, Piotr is the first to wish other Harvesters happy birthday with his signature Photoshopped cakes. Though he grew up with turtles, mice, guinea pigs, bunnies, dogs, cats, and parrots, he doesn’t currently have a pet.
Justin Vernon is from BethAnne’s hometown, which is why she added For Emma, Forever Ago to the Harvest HQ record collection. Even though she’s a super friendly Harvest Expert who spends her days helping customers, she was somehow sorted into Slytherin.
A developer whose face has become one of our most popular custom Slack emojis, Cade spends his free time baking bread, brewing beer, and barbecuing butts. When asked about the strangest place he’s ever worked, he answered, “the bathroom.”
Jamie helps new customers discover the features they’re looking for in Harvest. Her favorite Harvest memory is completing an escape room with a small group of Harvesters at one of the team’s summits, followed by dinner, drinks, and great conversation.
While on a roadtrip across the United States, Pez once had to work with his laptop on an electrical transformer outside a car dealership in middle-of-nowhere Utah. What else can you do when the motel wifi isn’t working?
