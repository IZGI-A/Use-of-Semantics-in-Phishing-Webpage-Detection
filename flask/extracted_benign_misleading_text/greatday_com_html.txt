Pointing the way
To improve what you do, you must first improve what you want to do. You cannot expect to achieve new, improved results with the same old priorities and desires.
Every success first happens in your own heart, with your own desires. Every achievement is a product of personal commitment.
Your thoughts and actions enable you to make progress in one direction or another. Yet it is your heart that tells you which specific direction to go.
Where you are now is connected to where you previously wanted to be. Where do you want to be next, who do you want to be, how do you truly want to live?
You’re talented and experienced at achieving your desires. Be sure to choose those desires with care.
Every moment brings you closer to the reality of your future. And every moment, your desires are pointing the way.
