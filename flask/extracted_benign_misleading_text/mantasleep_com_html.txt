I love my Manta Sleep Mask. Literally sleep with it every night. It has been the best find this past year. If you're thinking about buying it, stop, and just do it.
why choose
manta sleep?
Most sleep masks are uncomfortable, don’t block out light, and fall apart in two weeks. There’s a better option: Manta Sleep Mask. Think of it as the first class of sleep masks. We are obsessed with:
100% total darkness
Zero eye pressure
Absolute comfort
Material science

I suffer from dry eye syndrome, therefore, I always have to wear an eye mask to sleep. I've tried many different eye masks for the past two years, but they were always too loose, too tight, or they didn't cover my entire eye area (to prevent dry air from entering).
I purchased the Manta Sleep Mask a couple of weeks ago and it was worth every penny! It covers my eyes completely and doesn't move out of place. I want to say thank you to the creator of the Manta Sleep Mask!
I have fibromyalgia. Total insomniac. Tried every sleep mask out there. This one is LEGIT!! Love it. Blocks out ALL light. Doesn’t move at all or pull your hair. Ordered 2 and they were delivered so fast. Ordering 2 more!!! 👍😀👏😴

I am a night shift nurse, and I could not survive without my Manta mask! This is not an overstatement.
The first thing I do when I get home from work is make sure I find my mask. It is VITAL to my very short sleep before I have to wake up and go back to saving lives.
Your product is amazingly comfortable, and I absolutely believe that is helps me get the rest that I need so I can actually function on 4 hours sleep. I am always telling my coworkers how awesome you are, and 5 of them have bought your mask as a result.
I’ve tried flimsy sleep masks from the grocery store and some from Amazon. Since I’m a side sleeper, they usually squish my eyes and eyelashes! Every single problem is resolved with the Manta Sleep Mask...
I’ve tried flimsy sleep masks from the grocery store and some from Amazon. Since I’m a side sleeper, they usually squish my eyes and eyelashes! Every single problem is resolved with the Manta Sleep Mask.
This is the best sleep mask the world has ever known. Total blackout sleep, very comfortable, doesn’t get hot, no readjusting or hair pulling. If you're not happy with this product, I'm not sure how to help you.
I bought a whole bouquet of your sleep masks because after I tried it, my whole family and friends had to have one. It’s amazing. Hands down the best sleep mask ever made.
Can confirm, my husband bought these and I questioned it because a sleep mask is a sleep mask, right?
Wrong. They are seriously worth the money.
This is the best sleep mask ever! After struggling to sleep more than 4 hours at a time this has helped tremendously! I had not slept for more than 4 hours since I had my triple bypass in 2009! I now sleep 8+ hours...
This is the best sleep mask ever! After struggling to sleep more than 4 hours at a time this has helped tremendously! I had not slept for more than 4 hours since I had my triple bypass in 2009! I now sleep 8+ hours sometimes more! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This is the Cadillac of sleep masks! It delivers on the 100% blackout promise, the micro-velcro strap doesn’t get stuck in your hair. It is comfortable, and fully worth the 30 bucks you pay. This mask is absolutely essential for shift workers.
I absolutely recommend this mask. I rate this mask 🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖 5 T-Rexes out of 5, because stars have no personality, but this mask does!
Bought 4 pairs. 1 for myself, 3 for presents. Best blackout eye mask ever! So comfortable. You can open your eyes with them on and no light comes through. A 15-year hunt is now over.

Hi there - huge fan of the Manta Sleep Mask! It’s completely transformed my sleep!
I track my sleep with my FitBit and I see a noticeable decline in time awake (and increase in deep sleep) when I sleep with my mask compared to when I don’t. Thanks for a great product (which I gifted to everyone in my family this Xmas LOL).
This sleep mask works TOO well! My first night wearing it and I slept so deeply I woke up at 11am. I am currently late to work by 2 hours for the first time in my life. I missed an important meeting too. Wow, this ...

My husband and I both have a Manta Sleep Mask and it has completely revamped the quality of our sleep. We've had them for almost a month and we feel more rested and energised in the morning. I'm tactile hypersensitive and for me it's really easy to sleep with it on.
We also use your blockout stickers and they've really helped as well :) Thanks for making good quality practical user friendly products!!

I recently purchased this. I was a little hesitant with the cost BUT I did it and have 0 regrets. Two reasons why I love it more than any other mask I’ve used:
#1- Other masks that lay flat on my eyes have actually ruined the way my eyelashes curl. I’d put mascara on and they were all wonky from being flattened every night. This face mask doesn’t even really touch my eyes. I can actually open my eyes and blink with it on!
#2- I can nap with makeup on and it stays intact!! Super comfy, awesome! 5 stars for this product!
This Manta mask is the real deal! I saw it on Facebook a couple months ago and immediately told my husband that I wanted it for Christmas. He ordered it on December 19 and it got to us December 24!

Obviously he’s a major procrastinator (I love him anyway!) but this mask is everything a sleep mask should strive to be! I love it so much!

Hello. I LOVE MY MANTA MASK!
I live in the San Francisco bay area, and to me, this is like the "Alcatraz Solitary Confinement" of masks! The complete darkness is unparalleled! I have never gotten a better night's sleep than I have with this mask.
Seriously one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. I was worried because I’m a side/stomach sleeper. I didn’t need to worry - this thing is worth every cent. I’m buying a heap for Christmas presents this year 👍👍👍
I'm ALWAYS skeptical of Facebook targeted advertisements, but I took a leap of faith buying this mask and I could NOT be more happy with it.

Super comfy, complete blackout, and just really well designed overall. I have a hard time sleeping without it now but that's ok because it's freakin great.
Absolutely amazing. I work late shifts now and usually sleep when the sun rises and have had terrible sleep. These are so comfy and the ability to adjust them is just so great.
Not shilling or being paid. Love em. Thank y'all 😊

I’ve tried every kind of sleep mask possible. Most of them are terrible, either uncomfortable, ill-fitting, or ineffective. The Manta Mask is the only one I’ve ever used that solves all these problems. It lets in no light whatsoever and is so comfortable and adjustable that you barely know it’s there. I’m buying a second one to put in my suitcase for traveling and recommending it to everyone I know.

If you are a night shift worker, traveler or just need total blackout to get a decent sleep, this is the mask!
I’ve tried many masks and this is the only one that truly blocks out the light and does not put pressure on my eyes.
I am a side sleeper and this mask is comfortable, light and stays in place.
I just received my mask. I have waited 21 years for this product. This is the most exceptional product I have ever purchased. It will bring years of happiness to me. Thanks for your creation.

I bought two sets - one each for Hubby and I to wear on our trip overseas. At first he refused to wear it, but then he tried it once and was addicted! He’s scared to wear it on weekdays now because he’s afraid he will sleep through work! He said he gets a better night’s sleep on planes and at home. Thanks Manta for a fantastic product!! 😍😍😍

I’ve been using sleep masks for close to 15 years to get a good night’s sleep. On most eye masks, the fabric wears, the Velcro weakens, and the elastic stretches too far, making the mask eventually unusable.
When I saw the Manta Sleep Mask I was intrigued, but skeptical. I’m really glad I decided to give it a try. Not only is the mask everything that was advertised, it’s actually better.
It is truly a blackout sleep mask. No asterisk here. Daytime, nighttime, it doesn’t matter. Once you adjust the mask to fit your face specifically, it truly blacks out all light. Not most - ALL. I have never experienced that before in a sleep mask.
I’ve been using it for over a month now and it is still the same as the first time I used it. Take it from a guy who’s done this dance with sleep masks for 15 years: I will never use another besides this one.
I just wanted to say that I bought a Manta Sleep Mask and it’s been a gamechanger for my sleep quality. I have bought almost 10 different brands of sleep masks over the past few years so I can speak with some...

You have somehow managed a comfortable design that really keeps ALL light out of my eyes. It really works and I’m completely sold. Thanks to you and the designers at Manta for finally solving the sleep mask problem. This product is truly amazing!

The Manta Sleep Mask does everything promised. It is adjustable, comfortable, washable, and blocks all light. I am very happy with it and much less grumpy in general. Thank you Manta!
As a ridiculously light sleeper, I've tried a ton of sleep masks over the years. I thought I had found the best one.....until I tried yours. OMG, hands down the BEST SLEEP MASK EVER. LOVE it!!!! Everyone should have one.
These masks are a game changer. I travel so much and I have two masks. One for home and one for the red-eye flights. I usually hate sleep masks but Manta is brilliant.
