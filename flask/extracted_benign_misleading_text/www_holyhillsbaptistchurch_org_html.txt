Looking for flashing lights, fog machines, and contemporary praise and worship music being sung from a drop down screen?
THIS IS NOT THAT CHURCH!
Our church offers an old-fashioned, inviting atmosphere where we sing traditional hymns from song books and preach and teach out of the King James Bible.
AMEN!
Located in northwest Tennessee, our church is easily accessible, just off of Interstate 55, on the Highway 51 Bypass.
We would be honored to have you join us for any of our services!
