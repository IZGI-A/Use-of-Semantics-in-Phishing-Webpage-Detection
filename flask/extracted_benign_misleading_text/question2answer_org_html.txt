What is a Question and Answer site?
A Q&A site helps your online community to share knowledge. People with questions get the answers they need. The community is enriched by commenting, voting, notifications, points and rankings.

Your members will enjoy the interaction that Q&A enables, and will visit your site more regularly. In addition, many web searches are questions, so Q&A content will attract search engine traffic.
What is Question2Answer?
Question2Answer (Q2A) is a popular open source Q&A platform for PHP/MySQL, currently running on 23,608 sites in 40 languages.
How do I get Q2A?
Download Question2Answer 1.8.3, then read how to install. Version 1.8.3 was released on January 12th, 2019. Also on GitHub.
What does Q2A need?
- PHP 5.2 or later, with the MySQLi extension.
- MySQL MySQL 5.0 or later.
It's strongly recommended to use the latest version of PHP (7.x) and MySQL if possible as they bring many performance enhancements and each major release of Q2A typically drops support for an older version.
