Pick up a bike at one of hundreds of stations around the Chicago area. See bike availability on the System Map or mobile app.
Bike share is great for quick trips around town or leisurely rides through the park. Use it to commute to work or school, run errands and explore the city.
End a ride by returning your bike to any station. Slide your bike firmly into an empty dock and wait for the green light to make sure it's locked.
“Biking is such a fun alternative to other forms of transportation! And Divvy makes it incredibly convenient.”
