Selling your boat doesn't get any easier.
We only get paid when you get paid.
Started in 2009, POP Yachts quickly started to make a name for itself. Sellers appreciated our fair marketing agreement and friendly attitude. They liked it and they spoke up. Expectations have shifted since. Looking back, it's hard to believe how different things were before we arrived.
Local Representation
We strive to have local representation in all major boating areas. In the event we have local representation in your area, we want to get to know your vessel, take 100+ professional photos and a video.
Brilliant Marketing
We post our boat advertisements on 166 websites, including BoatTrader.com, boats.com, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, MoreBoats.com, and on and on and on.
Secure Transaction
We have a fully-staffed closing department to make sure showings and survey go smoothly. We process all funds safely through escrow and we handle all the paperwork.
