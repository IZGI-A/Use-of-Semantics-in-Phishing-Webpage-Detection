My greatest friend in the world had a terrible disease. For New Year's Day, I made a word cloud art with her favourite people in the shape of a heart. I was crying while making it. Thank you for this unique way to send love to my friend!

I recently started using this program and absolutely love it. It took me a couple hours to figure out all the little nuances to it, like locking the words, moving and locking, and once I saw that I can import fonts...well game on! My thanks to the developers of this program!

Me and my brother would like to setup a word art business along with other personalized items. We came across your site and must admit it is the best for producing word cloud art.
