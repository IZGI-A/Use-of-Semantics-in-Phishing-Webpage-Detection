PROPERTY SEARCH SCORING
Search Scoring utilizes the following criteria:
|Term Frequency
|Inverse Document Frequency
Term Frequency is the rate at which a term shows up in TAD’s database. The higher number of matches of a term, the higher up in the list it will display.
Inverse Document Frequency is the rate at which the term you searched for shows up in documents. Unlike Term Frequency, this option shows up higher in the results list when there are less occurrences in the document. For example, if you searched for the word “the” you wouldn’t get many results based on documents we have on file. If you searched for the word “xylophone” you would likely get a result from the documents based on that word.
