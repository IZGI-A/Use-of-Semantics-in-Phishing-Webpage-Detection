We are the nation's largest funder of health and care research and provide the people, facilities and technology that enables research to thrive. Working in partnership with the NHS, universities, local government, other research funders, patients and the public, we deliver and enable world-class research that transforms people's lives, promotes economic growth and advances science.
We are primarily funded by the Department of Health and Social Care, but also receive UK Aid funding to support research for people in low- and middle-income countries.
NIHR's mission is to improve the health and wealth of the nation through research. We deliver against this mission through five strategic workstreams.
The NIHR's work is directed by leaders at Department of Health and Social Care working in partnership with the directors of our seven coordinating centres.
The NIHR is a central part of the UK research landscape, collaborating in national activities to improve research and supporting NHS research performance.
