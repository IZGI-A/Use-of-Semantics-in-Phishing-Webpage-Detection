This program has saved a lot of administrative time when compared to our previous software because it is so fast and easy to use.
I tell all of my ministry friends about ChurchTrac. We are relatively a small church with a limited staff but having ChurchTrac in our corner empowers us to function wiser and be more effective.
EXCELLENT Customer service. They are super nice and always willing to help me make the software work for what I need.
When I discovered ChurchTrac, I found a great treasure of opportunities at a very affordable price.
This is a great product. It's definitely the most user-friendly option out there. It does everything I could ask for and the cost is fantastic.
I'm amazed at the functionality that is being offered for this price. Nothing else I've seen comes close.
I have used many different church software companies... ChurchTrac has better support than all of them. This is a must have for ministry!
We left Fellowship One and found ChurchTrac, an easy-to-use software and a price that just can't be beat. Their mission is obvious from their passion to serve their customers.
