“InflatableOffice does as much as a part time employee would“
“A business partner recently asked about the cost of using InflatableOffice, saying that the enterprise rate seemed a bit high. After reviewing everything that InflatableOffice does for our business, including e-mail automation, on-line quotes & contracts, inventory management, worker scheduling, multi-location support and more, I told him that InflatableOffice does as much as a part time employee would, without the hassle of hiring, training and certainly without the cost. I could never hire someone to do all the things IO does for us, at a fraction of the cost of a real person!

“InflatableOffice has changed not only my business but also my personal life.“
“We just started using the program in June and wish I would have done so ages ago. InflatableOffice has changed not only my business but also my personal life. It has freed up my time so that I can spend more time with my children. The program is extremely user friendly and definitely provides for my business to more organized and professional. My customers love it too which is, as we all know, the most important aspect. If our customers aren't happy, then we aren't happy. The customer support provided by Tim and Joel surpasses my expectations. They are always there when you need them and are always open to new ideas. I like the fact that they continue to grow with their options and impress me every time they come up with another new enhancement. Thank you InflatableOffice!

“IO outperforms ERS hands down in every way“
I have used both systems. IO outperforms ERS hands down in every way. As far as the website goes, most ERS users have a website designed by Dave Barnes who built my IO site for not much more than he does full custom ERS sites for. Having the ability to create my own site and not be forced into templates helps make all the difference to me. The biggest factor that IO has is their quote page converts better than the ERS checkout process. It just plain outperforms it and my bank account has proven that. Thanks Tim Beck for a stellar product!
