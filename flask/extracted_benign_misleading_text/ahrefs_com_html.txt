When it comes to backlink analysis, Ahrefs is my #1 go-to tool. I've tested over 25 link analysis tools and none comes close to Ahrefs in terms of index size, freshness and overall usability. If you're serious about SEO, you need Ahrefs.

As part of our job at Authority Hacker, we test every SEO tool out there to try and determine which is the best. Because Ahrefs comes ahead in 99% of the cases, some of our readers are starting to call us biased. Please stop being good at everything, it's hurting our reputation.

What I love about Ahrefs is their commitment to speed, design and innovation. The data is fresh, relevant, and granular enough to allow us to make very actionable decisions.

We use Ahrefs mainly for its site explorer, and it’s immensely improved how we find link targets. We use it both for getting quick analysis of a site, as well as utilizing its extensive index when we want to dive deep. It's invaluable to have one tool that can do both of those things.
