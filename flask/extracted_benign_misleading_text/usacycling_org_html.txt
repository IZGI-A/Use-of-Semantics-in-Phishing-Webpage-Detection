Unite The Community
Our mission is to develop the sport of cycling in the United States at all levels by bringing together cyclists, coaches, event promoters, community leaders, volunteers, and fans to form communities of those who want to see the sport of cycling prosper. We harness the passion so many have for cycling and turn it into opportunities for us all to enjoy the sport together.
Develop Our Nation’s Best
We identify, develop, and support athletes to represent the United States at the biggest events in the world, from the Tour de France to the Olympics. We’re proud of the legacy of outstanding American cyclists we’ve helped create, and with your support, we can continue bringing promising talent from the neighborhood cul-de-sac to the Olympic podium.
Protect & Promote Our Sport
Cycling is a rich and widely loved sport, but it needs protecting and nurturing. We partner with individuals and organizations to enhance cycling safety, advocate for cyclists rights, and promote the positive impact cycling has on individuals and communities across the country.
