YOUR IDENTITY IS AT RISK!
It is time to get active protecting your personal data. Get your personal SafeZone Pass today for maximum privacy and for maximum security. The SafeZone is a fast-growing network of websites which is setting new privacy, security, and quality standards on the Internet.
Your SafeZone Pass includes a unique PerNum, a personal number that protects your privacy. Instead of sharing your name, your email address, your phone number, or even your credit card details, you simply share your PerNum, while your personal data is safe on our military-grade encrypted and protected SafeZone servers.
Now, when you for example subscribe for a newsletter, instead of your email address, you enter your PerNum. The website delivers the newsletter through our servers without knowing who you are.
Within the SafeZone, all websites are secured by SSL encryption for your safety. On top of that, each website is scanned on a daily basis for any hacking attempts or possible malware threats.
Whenever you open a page in the SafeZone, you can rest assured that you are protected.
As a SafeZone member, your data is protected by 2-step authentication. Besides your password you need a 3-digit one-time PIN each time you are logging in to the SafeZone. This one-time PIN is randomly generated from a Master PIN that only you know. Thus, no hacker can enter your account.
Your SafeZone Pass is at the same time your global-local bonus card. No matter if online or at local retail stores, restaurants and service providers, whenever you see the Perfect Bonus logo, you are qualified to receive exclusive special offers, coupons, and discounts.
