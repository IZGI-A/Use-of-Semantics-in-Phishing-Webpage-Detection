A Sofar gig is an intimate show held in an unique venue, like someone's living room or an antique shop. It typically features three artists, playing four songs each. Every lineup is specially curated to give our audiences a diverse show.
It’s free! Apply up until the day before show time or tickets sell out, whichever comes first.
If selected, you'll receive an email to purchase your tickets.
Purchase tickets for yourself and friends. Then we’ll email you with the venue location at least a day before the show.
Sharing the moment in an amazing setting with a curated audience of extraordinary people.
