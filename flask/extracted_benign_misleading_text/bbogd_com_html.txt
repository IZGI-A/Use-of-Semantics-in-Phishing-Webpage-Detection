Lands of LordsRated5Oct 15th by Dworkim
This game have a really good potential, yet it's pretty bad.
80% of the time you will spend on it will be micro-managment, and it's boring.
18% of the other will be building things, and the last 2% will go to war or roleplay (you will need to choose).
You can pay to have a big time boost once a day, and to have access to more powerfull units.
Also, the best way to protect yourself against your enemies is to be friend with the Admin
