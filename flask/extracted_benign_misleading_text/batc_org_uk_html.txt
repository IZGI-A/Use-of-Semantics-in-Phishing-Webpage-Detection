Whether it’s watching live video from the International Space Station, developing high speed data links to carry digital TV signals, helping produce programs for live streaming, building pre-amps and high power amplifiers for the microwave bands or restoring vintage cameras and outside broadcast vans, the world of Amateur Television (ATV) has something to interest everyone!
Amateur Television is a fascinating area of Amateur Radio covering all aspects of video production, editing, transmission and reception of Television and has always been at the fore front of the technology revolution. Many stations are now transmitting Digital pictures (DATV) using the DVB broadcast standards and using video streaming technologies to exchange pictures with ATV operators around the world.
