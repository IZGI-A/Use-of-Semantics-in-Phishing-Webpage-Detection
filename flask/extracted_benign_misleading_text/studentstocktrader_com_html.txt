How does it work?
Teachers create a new game. They are given a join code which can be passed onto students. A student can join the game with this join code and begin buying and selling stocks.
Each student will be given a unqiue game code that can be used to rejoin the game at a later date or on another device.
Teachers have full control over the game, they can view each student's portfolio and have the ability to reward and fine students.
Friendly Competition
Students can play in groups or individually, each game has a leaderboard that shows the real time progress of each player.
Look for Trends
Our stock data is loosely based on real data, this means that the wordwide economy will impact on the trading decisions of students.

Demystify the Stock Market
To some students the stock market is a mass of numbers, our simple tool helps remove this perception.
