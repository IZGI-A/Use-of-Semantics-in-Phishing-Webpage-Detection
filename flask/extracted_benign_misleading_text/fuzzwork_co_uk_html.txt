You’re probably here to see the blueprint calculator, or the LP store calculator. Both of these are under the Tools menu just above this text. Enjoy, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to drop me a mail in game, to Steve Ronuken.
If you have no idea what Eve Online is, It’s a Massively Multiplayer game, set in the far future, where you play a Starship pilot, who is immortal, being copied into a new body, every time they die. Kill your enemies. Build stuff. Gather resources. Play the market. With 500,000 other accounts, all in the same game universe. If they play Eve, you can interact with them (Unless they’re in China. There are only two ‘servers’ to play on) Go to the Eve Online site to learn more. If you like the look of it, you can try it out for free. EVE has a free to play option, called an Alpha clone. It’s limited in what skills it can learn, but it’s otherwise free to use. If you sign up using the buddy program you’ll get an extra 1,000,000 skill points to start with. If you end up buying PLEX, let me know when you do, and I’ll throw over the accelerators I get. Feel free to ask me questions, though I’d suggest you peruse the Getting Started category. I’m slowly fleshing it out with useful stuff. There’s also Eve University and their Wiki which is a wonderful resource for information. The ISK guide is also useful.
If you’re looking for my blog, it’s under the ‘POST’ menu item above.
If you’re looking to find out more about me, well, I’ve not written that page yet. I’ll get to it at some point. Short version: I’m a High-sec Industrialist who dabbles in lowsec PvP, and does third party development for Eve. I Stood for, and was elected to CSM 9,through to 14 on a platform of Industry and Third party development (which affects most players. You’re here, after all)
