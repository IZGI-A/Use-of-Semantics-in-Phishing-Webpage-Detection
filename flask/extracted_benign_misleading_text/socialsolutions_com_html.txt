Committed
Your organization is full of passion and you’re dedicated to making an impact on the community your organization is serving. Most, if not all, organizations start here, working on pen and paper (or spreadsheets!) to keep track of data. Service delivery is important, but you don’t have a clear picture of where to start effectively tracking data and assessing it to measure any outcomes.
Counting Outputs
Your organization has taken the first formal step of your data journey. You have an electronic system in place to collect data, and it’s possible your reporting is compliance-driven. Your organization has growth potential to make your reporting more efficient, but you don’t have full insight into your service delivery and that holds you back from understanding your outcomes and proving your impact.
Measuring Outcomes
Your organization has mastered counting and measuring outputs and has started measuring outcomes to a certain degree. Using the outputs that are available to you, you can see the long-term effects of your service delivery. Your organization has potential to continue to grow and use your data in a more efficient way, but you aren’t quite ready to see the overarching impact your organization has on the community.
Managing Outcomes
Your organization has fully grasped what it means to be high performing and data driven. You use the outputs you track to measure your outcomes, which inform your decision-making process when deciding what works best for your service delivery. You can clearly see your impact on the community you serve because you have full access to the outcomes you diligently track.
