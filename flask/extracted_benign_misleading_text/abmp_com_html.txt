ABMP Membership Benefits
Professional Liability Insurance You Can Trust

Professional Liability Insurance You Can Trust
ABMP members have individual coverage, so all policy limits are yours and not subject to a master policy limit like AMTA. In an accident you call us first, not an insurance company—we don't leave you to face a difficult situation alone. There's no upcharge for Additional Insured Endorsements, and you can even add optional Business Personal Property insurance to protect your equipment. Simply put, you can trust that you're taken care of with ABMP.
