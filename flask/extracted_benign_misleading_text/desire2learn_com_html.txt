Oh, Iâ€™m getting feedback from my students now, too...they love it! No more deciphering cryptic text comments in feedback box. I think you hit a home run with this one! Thanks for the continued improvements and for listening to your customers!!

Thanks for sharing this Lauren! Also thanks to the staff @htubman2015 for the representation of @D2L As a kinder teacher for 6 years, I adopted #D2L from the start and NEVER turned back. I currently teach 1/2 and still use it everyday! @dsbn @EarlyYears_HPE #EarlyEdChat

Pausing to share a little @D2L love. While composing my discussion post for my Intro to Drawing class, I am prompted to add alternative text to the image I attached. #Accessibility ftw! Kudos to @d2l & the #instructionaldesign team at @UMUC for making that #design decision.

Uploading some sweet math work onto our @D2L bright space portfolio today! The voice recording feature is perfect for us!! #ESC #HCDSBMath #battleship #gridcoordinates @HCDSB @StBrigidHCDSB

Students are learning how to use the Brightspace app today. They love scanning their new Funster QR codes. Ss are learning to share and save their ideas about their learning in the D2L. We remember to speak loud and clear into the microphone! Great job!

I love the ability to track progress over time ... This greatly enhances the ability to have a real feel of value added and boosts return on investment (RoI) ... Well done @D2L @BrightspaceHelp

Shiza! Gotta say @D2L, I am VERY impressed! You've been listening & I now see the results in redesign of existing tools! Building a #Rubric from scratch (it's been awhile ðŸ˜‰ I #LOVE the add/remove #criteria & levels AND the tally adjusts auto-magically! cc: @BrightspaceHelp

I'm so pleased the new annotation tool in Brightspace @D2L. It streamlines and modernizes feedback for students in the online classroom. #modernizedlearning #eLearning #annotation #assessment #studentfriendlyfeedback #eLearningTeacher
