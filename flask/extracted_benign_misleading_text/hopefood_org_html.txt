Great Volunteers
Clothing
Our clothes closet is open and helps with clothing and household items.
Prayer
The most important need that anyone has is prayer to a loving Father. Every food recipient is given the opportunity to have someone pray for them.
Food
We provide high quality food to help our community's families in need.
HOURS
We are open the third Saturday of the month from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.
The Backbone of Our Organization
Our volunteers have one thing in common--We love the Lord Jesus Christ and we desire to lift His name up in our community and be his hands and feet extended.
We're here to help meet the needs of those who are hurting in the community of Aubrey and the surrounding area.
Volunteers from several churches from around Denton County are involved in helping with this food pantry.
HOPE has many volunteer opportunities at different times during the week. We need skilled labor, people to help run fundraisers, people to pack boxes.
How You Can Help
We always welcome large contributions, but because we serve children, families and seniors facing hunger in our community, even the smallest year-end contribution goes a long way.
