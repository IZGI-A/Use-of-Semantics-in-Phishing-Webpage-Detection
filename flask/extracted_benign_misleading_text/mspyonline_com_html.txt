About mSpy Tracking Software
We would all love to live in an ideal world where we didn’t have to worry about unscrupulous employees or children put in harm’s way. Unfortunately, we live in a world where abounding dangers surround us and our loved ones daily. Because of this, we must do everything we can to maintain the requisite security needed to see our businesses flourish and our kids grow up to be happy, healthy and of course, safe young adults.
That’s where mSpy comes in. The advanced software technology built into the monitoring app lets parents and employers keep a watchful eye over the people and things most dear to them. With mSpy, everyday worries are greatly lifted so that you can once again focus your energies on being more productive businessmen and business ladies, as well as more attentive parents.
With mSpy, you can know:
- How safe children are when you’re not around
- What troubles them most
- Who they have contacts with
- What places they visit
- What they visit online
- How to reduce identity theft risk
- How productive your employees are
Business owners should be confident that mSpy is the best tool to maintain integrity among employees. The following must be upheld by all business-owners:
- Prior consent by employees to monitor devices
- Keep the monitoring strictly work-related
mSpy for Cell Phone Tracking
mSpy is a state-of-the-art solution that gives you deep insight into problems and dangers your children and business face before they ever happen!
Once installed on the monitored smartphone or tablet, our mobile tracking app starts tracking everything, including call logs, GPS location, emails, browsing history, text messages, chats, photos, and videos. It even remotely blocks inappropriate websites & apps, prevents unwanted contacts from calling, and more! You will have access to the information you are looking for no matter where you are.
Simply log in to your secure mSpy account from any device that has Internet connection and check device use details, captured by our mobile tracking application control panel.
For those wishing to supervise an iOS device, you have two monitoring options:
mSpy for Jailbroken & Non-Jailbroken Devices
How mSpy Without Jailbreak Works:
To install mSpy on a non-jailbroken device, you must simply obtain the iCloud credentials of the monitored device and turn on the features you wish to have monitored. After you have correctly filled in the required fields in the Wizard Setup, you may log into your Control Panel to view data logs of the user’s device activity.
Who will benefit from mSpy Without Jailbreak?
Anyone who is looking for advanced monitoring software but doesn’t want to jailbreak a device in order to receive these services. There is no physical installation needed. You are only required to have access to the user’s iCloud credentials.
When choosing mSpy Without Jailbreak, you have access to the following monitoring features:
- Call Logs
- Contacts
- Text Messages
- Browser History
- Events
- Notes
For those who are looking for a wider range of features for monitoring an iOS device, we suggest opting for traditional mSpy, although the device must be jailbroken to enjoy these added monitoring tools.
Is this Monitoring Software Legal?
Here are some things you may not have known:
- Nearly 43% of kids have been bullied online. 1 in 4 has had it happen more than once.
- Only 1 in 10 cyber bullying victims will inform a parent or a trusted adult of their abuse.
- Bullying victims are 2 to 9 times more likely to consider committing suicide.
When used appropriately, safety software, such as mSpy, can save your child’s life or prevent harm from coming to them.
Children these days live in the virtual world as much, if not more, than in the real one. However, despite this virtual reality, the risks they face are very real. You would not leave your unsupervised minor child home alone, or with a stranger; so why would you leave them unsupervised in the virtual world? Left online unattended, kids might make irresponsible choices that could expose them to dangers such as drugs or alcohol, cyber-bullying, premature sex, and other reckless behavior. When parents are tuned in to their kid’s activities, such dangers can be prevented. If you have children, you’ll understand the value of being two steps ahead.
So is the use of cell phone tracking apps for supervising underage kids really legal? The answer is yes.
What about business owners? mSpy is the primary choice when it comes to mobile monitoring solutions. If you are a business owner who ignores your employees’ counter-productive activities, it is highly unlikely you will remain in business for very long. With mSpy’s monitoring software, you’ll automatically collect information about how they are performing their job. If someone deserves to be fired, you’ll know about it. If someone leaked corporate data, you’ll be in the know. Should you fear legal challenges from your employees for monitoring them with mobile tracking software? No, the law is on your side as long as you:
- Notify your employees about monitoring and get their written consent.
- Describe what constitutes permissible and prohibited work-related IT equipment use.
- Keep the monitoring strictly work-related.
Important Note: mSpy is helping parents monitor their young kids and helping businesses monitor their employees’ use of IT equipment with the knowledge and consent of the employees. Our software was designed to help keep children safe and employees productive.
