Really good app on my phone that helps me plan and follow my route it all so keeps me in touch with friends and what?s happening and ideas for some fantastic new walks. It?s also fantastic when I travel to other countries and it shows me routes that other people have done.

The app has opened up the countryside in which I have lived for 20 years. The convenient planning format and turn by turn directions is more convenient than using maps. As a result, I have learned more about my local area in 3 months than the previous 19.75 years. Of course, purchasing an eMTB 3 months ago has also helped!
This app inspired me to get outside & explore!
