Hey everyone!
We have now released MythicMobs v4.6.5 for everyone! This update will run on 1.14, and also has lots of bug fixes that we've merged from the 4.7 dev builds!

If you're upgrading from 4.5 make sure to read the changelog to see all the new goodies.
If you're happy that we've made v4.6 free for everyone, please make sure to leave a 5 star review on spigot and consider donating or subscribing to MythicMobs premium so we can keep working hard on new stuff!
You can get it from the Download tab. Have fun everyone!

We've gone ahead and released v4.5.0 as a "stable" build for all premium users.
This version includes both 1.13 support and full support for backwards compatibility. We have rewritten huge parts of the plugin to be both backwards and forwards compatible and continue to support as far back as 1.8 where possible. This was a massive internal update due to the nature of 1.13's sweeping changes.
Item configs should not require updating, as we've added in a "translator" to ensure the old item IDs and data values will still be usable, even on 1.13+. There may be cases we missed though, so please submit bug reports if you encounter problems!
