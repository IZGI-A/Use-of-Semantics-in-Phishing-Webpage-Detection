Purchase of Membership/Additional Purchases/Auto-Renewal. Upon purchase of membership, a Registered Non-Member shall become a Member and shall have access to all Member privileges. All Services not included in the membership fee shall be provided at additional charge. Your membership will continue indefinitely until cancelled by You. After Your initial purchase of membership, and again after any subsequent membership period, Your membership will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when initially purchasing the membership. You agree that your account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature. If You want to change or terminate your membership in any of the Websites, please contact our customer support. If You cancel Your membership, You may use your membership until the end of Your then-current membership term and Your membership will not be renewed thereafter. However, You won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the membership fee paid for the then-current membership period. By purchasing the 1 (one) calendar month membership, You authorize AsianDate.com to charge Your credit card, debit card or other payment method at such time and again, as Your membership will automatically renew at the beginning of any subsequent membership period, unless canceled by You prior to the expiration of any membership period, including any sales or similar taxes imposed on Your membership payments. Unless otherwise indicated in any applicable additional terms or communications AsianDate.com sends to Your registered email address, the renewal membership will be at the same membership fee as when you first subscribed (unless your first month was purchased at a promotional rate), plus any applicable taxes, unless AsianDate.com notifies You at least 10 days prior to the end of your current term that the membership fee will increase. You acknowledge and agree that your payment method will be automatically charged for such membership fees, plus any applicable taxes, upon each such automatic renewal. You acknowledge that your membership is subject to automatic renewals and You consent to and accept responsibility for all recurring charges to your credit or debit card (or other payment method, as applicable) based on this automatic renewal feature without further authorization from You and without further notice except as required by law. In the event Your credit card, debit card or other payment method chosen by You to renew Your membership is declined, You authorize Amolatina.com to charge any other credit card, debit card or bank account listed on file with your membership account. You further acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may change if the applicable tax rates change or if you are notified that there will be an increase in the applicable membership fees. Upon the renewal of Your membership, if AsianDate.com does not receive payment, You agree that AsianDate.com may either terminate or suspend your membership and continue to attempt to charge Your payment method provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new membership commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received). Upon de-activation of Your membership, all privileges associates with Your membership shall be revoked, provided that Your profile shall remain searchable by other Members. You shall retain the right to browse other Membersâ€™ profiles and to make changes to Your own profile. You may re-activate your membership by signing up and paying the membership fee.
-
Female Members. AsianDate functions to provide the opportunity to its male and female Members to effectively and comfortably search for their prospective soul mate. AsianDate does not influence the relationships between male and female Members of the Websites. Female Members may terminate their membership with the Websites at any time. Deactivation of profiles of female Members of the Websites is governed by the following:
-
In the event a female Member is no longer interested in the Services, AsianDate customer support administrators shall review the correspondence between such female Member and a male Member with whom the female Member has been corresponding (the "Correspondent") and shall have the right to make a decision, in their sole discretion, with respect to the issuance of unused credits back to the male Member. Notwithstanding the above, AsianDate customarily issues no more than 10 credits back to the Correspondent for such Correspondentâ€™s last letter to the deactivated female Member.
-
In the event a female Member had requested her profile to be deleted from the Websites for unspecified personal reasons, the Correspondent shall not have the right to receive any information with respect to the deletion of such female Member's profile, as same would be in violation of AsianDate's Privacy Policy. Furthermore, the Correspondent shall not be entitled to any unused credits with respect to his correspondence with such female Member. AsianDate may, at its discretion, issue 10 credits back to Correspondent's account for Correspondent's last letter to the female Member, if this letter was the last one in their correspondence.
-
In the event, a female Member had found her match, and same is not the Correspondent, the Correspondent shall not be entitled to any unused credits with respect to this correspondence with such female Member.
-
In the event, a female Member had been reported for inappropriate activities, AsianDate may, at its sole and unfettered discretion, issue a partial refund in credits to the Correspondent, who had informed the Websites of such female Member's inappropriate activity by providing incontrovertible evidence of same.
-
In the event, a female Member had been found on an anti-scam site, such female Member's profile may be deleted from the Websites provided that AsianDate, in its sole and unfettered discretion considers the supplied information substantial and irrefutable and issue a partial refund in credits to the Correspondent who provided such information.
-
-
Limitation of Liability. Except in jurisdictions where such provisions are restricted, in no event will AsianDate be liable to You or any third person for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages, including also lost profits arising from Your use of the Websites or the Service, as well as damages for loss of date, loss of programs, cost of procurement of substitute Services or Service interruptions, even if AsianDate knows or has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, AsianDateâ€™s liability to You for any cause whatsoever, and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to the amount paid, if any, by You to AsianDate for the Service during the term of membership.
-
U.S. Export Controls. Software from the Websites (the "Software") is further subject to United States export controls. No Software may be downloaded from the Websites or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Syria, or any other Country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone who is listed on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or on the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading or using the Software, You represent and warrant that You are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.
-
Disputes. You acknowledge that that the transactions involving your use of the Websites and your purchase of products or services took place in New York City, New York. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your visit to the Websites or to products or services sold or distributed by AsianDate or through AsianDate will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The arbitration shall take place in the city of New York, state of New York. New York law will govern the rights and obligations of the parties hereto with respect to the matters in controversy. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. But an arbitrator can award you the same damages and relief, and must honor the same terms in this agreement, as a court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. The arbitrator will allocate all costs and fees attributable to the arbitration between the parties hereto equally.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
You will attempt to resolve all disputes with respect to the Services through communication with AsianDate's customer service. If parties are unable to resolve the dispute, You must use the dispute resolution mechanism discussed above in this Section 14. You specifically acknowledge and agree that You will not attempt to chargeback any charges you authorized if you used the goods and/or Services provided. You further agree that should AsianDate demonstrate that a chargeback was unjustifiable, You shall incur an additional administrative charge of five cents ($ .05) cents per dollar of the amount of the chargeback. Such charge is not intended as a penalty, rather it shall be used to cover the administrative expenses incurred by AsianDate in connection with the chargeback. You shall also be required to pay any and all fees assessed by a credit card, bank or any other third party with respect to the chargeback which may range from $20 to $200 per chargeback, together with any reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and court costs incurred by AsianDate with respect to the reversal of said chargeback. Please also note should you chargeback any transactions billed to your account, AsianDate may be required to disclose any and/or all private communications sent/received by You through our Service in order to prove the validity of the charges billed to Your account and AsianDate's privacy policy will therefore not restrain any such disclosures.
-
Indemnity. You agree to indemnify and hold v, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and other partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorney's fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Your use of the Service in violation of this Agreement, and/or any allegations that any Content that You submit to AsianDate or transmit to the Websites infringe or otherwise violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or other rights of any third party; and/or arising from a breach of this Agreement and/or any breach of Your representations and warranties set forth above. This indemnity shall be applicable without regard to the negligence of any party, including any indemnified person.
-
Other. This Agreement, accepted upon use of the Websites and further affirmed by becoming a Member of the Service, contains the entire Agreement between You and AsianDate regarding the use of the Websites and/or the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
