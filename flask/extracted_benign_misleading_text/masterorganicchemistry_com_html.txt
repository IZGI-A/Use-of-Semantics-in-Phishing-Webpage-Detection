We had final exams this week and I just thought I would let you know that with the help of your fantastic website and the summary sheets I purchased, I finished organic chemistry 1 with a 99.5 average . Classmates were upset with me for being the curve buster. I blamed it on you and derected many of them to check out your website!

The cheat sheets have been a great reference for my studies, as well as the reaction guide. Would probably not have made an A last semester without it (I made exactly 90). I did it with the more difficult organic professor too!

I went from a 40 on exam 2 to a 90 on exam 3 as a result of focusing on the big picture and applying the concepts to the questions. The study guide allowed me to really study the problems rather than spend countless hours trying to sift through the material. I also ended up with a B+ in the class!

James Ashenhurst
Founder, Master Organic Chemistry
After doing a Ph. D. in organic synthesis at McGill and a postdoc at MIT, I applied for faculty positions at universities during the Great Recession. It didn’t work out. But having seen first-hand how many people struggled with the subject (including myself when I took it as an undergraduate) I thought there was a need for an online organic chemistry resource that had all the rigor of a traditional textbook, but was more approachable and accessible.
Drawing on the experience of thousands of hours spent tutoring students 1-on-1, as well as dozens of case studies, Master Organic Chemistry aims to fill in some of the conceptual gaps that aren’t traditionally covered by textbooks, and provide a friendly, logical and thorough pathway for learning introductory organic chemistry.
