We’re driven by our community.
Baz's story
I woke up and everything was spinning. For months afterwards I felt horrible. I wanted to die. I still get upset when I think about it.
Beth's story
Mum and I started baking after my stroke. It can be hard and sometimes I have to stop and rest, but it's fun and helps me get better. Me and mum are taking part in Give a Hand and Bake this year to help other stroke survivors get better.
Max's story
I had a stroke at my seventh birthday party. I got a pain on the right side of my head but I couldn’t cry because I lost my voice.
Paul's story
I was 40 when I had my stroke. My job before was as an English teacher. But now I can’t read or write, so my job is to help other stroke survivors. Stroke for me was a pause, not the end of the story.
Phillipa's story
I was having a stroke but my daughter, Beth, recognised the signs straight away by using the FAST test. Because Beth reacted so quickly I was able to get help sooner and make a better recovery.
Stuart's story
When Pam was in hospital I was so keen for her to get home, but the reality was really hard. Nobody had talked to me and explained what being a full time carer involved.
