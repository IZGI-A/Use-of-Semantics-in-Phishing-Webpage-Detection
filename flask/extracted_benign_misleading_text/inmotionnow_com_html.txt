We use inMotion to route our packaging labels and marketing collateral for review and approval before releasing the final artwork to our vendors. It’s a cost effective tool that helps organize workflow and track our progress to help ensure we hit our tight deadlines.
My designers absolutely love it, they don’t have to leave Adobe, and they don’t have to jump between platforms to upload a proof. They get to stay in their world and streamline the administrative parts of their job.
We did a lot of research, with other organizations, I even reached out to other teams to see what systems they were using, and in the end, inMotion was a great balance between what we needed, the cost, and the benefits.
