I am currently co-founder at PrepScholar, an educational technology company. We create online learning programs that understand each student’s strengths/weaknesses and learning style, then customizes the learning experience. PrepScholar currently focuses on private education and test preparation. We’re bootstrapped and happily profitable.
I like advising startups and founders. Contact me if you could use help on a problem or want to bounce ideas around.
I graduated from Harvard College with an AB/AM in Chemistry in 2009. I joined the MDPhD program at Harvard Medical School and MIT, and withdrew in 2013 to start my company.
