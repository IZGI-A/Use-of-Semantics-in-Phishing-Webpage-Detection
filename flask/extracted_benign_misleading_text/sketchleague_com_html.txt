Pictures and Dictionaries
Obscure (un-trademarked) terminology nonwithstanding, Sketch League is a game in which you take turns drawing pictures from a video game-related word list while other players guess. It's that simple, but we think you'll have fun anyways.
Get Social
Facebook is out, but that Sketch League is so hot right now. Make friends, add friends (coming soon!), draw with friends. We'll let you do the rest.
Share Your Work
Made a mastapiece? Unless you specifically chose to give it to us, your artwork is yours to keep. If you do send it our way, it might be featured on our social media accounts (with credit, of course)! Also share it on Imgur, Reddit, or put it on a blimp (and send us pictures when you do)!
