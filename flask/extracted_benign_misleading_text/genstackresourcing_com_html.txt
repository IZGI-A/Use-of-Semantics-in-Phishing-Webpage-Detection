Recruitment for User Experience & User Interface disciplines
About Us
Established in 2019, Genstack Resourcing is a boutique recruitment agency which aims to address the skills gap across the User Experience, User Interface & Information Architecture disciplines. Our vision is to source great candidates which help our clients provide a better and more secure user and customer journey.
Clients
Genstack Resourcing aims to develop lasting relationships with its clients to not only satisfy immediate hiring needs but to also be mindful of the development of the business in the longer term. We strive to be as much a business advisor as a supplier of high demand and difficult to find skill sets. This way of working allows us to anticipate our clientsâ€™ business demands and supply and recommend quality candidates ahead of time.
Candidates
Through specific searching, headhunting, networking and advertising, Genstack Resourcing connects with leading User Experience & User Interface candidates across the UK as well as in Europe. We develop good relationships with our candidates and endeavour to truly understand their career & life ambitions to only present opportunities which represent a step forward in the direction they want to go. Genstack Resourcing operates in a bespoke manner and, where possible, will proactively approach our clients on your behalf to create opportunities for both candidate and client if the match is right.
