Mumbai: Market leader Asian Paints Ltd's decorative segment registered a double-digit volume growth in the September quarter. But, the growth in the reporting quarter was lower than 16-17% growth in the June quarter.
According to analysts, volumes grew 13-14% in the September quarter mostly driven by low-end products, including distemper and putty.
"Even as domestic decoratives business reported double-digit volume growth, the core paints category rose just ~3% in our view," research house Morgan Stanley said in a report on 22 October.
Sharing a similar view, UBS Securities Pvt Ltd said, "We believe that the company has allowed mix dilution of 5-6% by pushing low-end putty throughput from newly added distributors."
As anticipated, benign raw material costs aided the company's gross margins which expanded more than 250 basis points (bps) year-on-year in the September quarter. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. Operating margin, however, rose only 60 bps, hit by higher staff cost and other expenditures.
The paint maker’s consolidated profit rose 67.5% y-o-y to ₹823.40 crore in the September quarter, aided by deferred tax reversal of around ₹149.7 crore. Adjusting for that, the company’s net profit grew 29% y-o-y, analysts said.
Shares of the company opened Wednesday’s session in the green, up about 1% at ₹1,783 on the NSE. However, the stock’s price has come off from its 52-week high of ₹1,825 it had touched ahead of its earnings on Tuesday.
On the valuations front, the company remains an expensive bet in the consumer discretionary basket. The stock is trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 60 times.
