What is ABA?
Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) implements interventions which research has found to be effective to change the behaviours that matter the most to the individual. Through observing behaviour, collecting data and systematically implementing interventions based on the most relevant research we can reduce problem behaviours as well as teach a wide variety of new skills. ABA can be used to change a wide range of behaviours for anyone and everyone.
ABA and Autism
ABA has been found to be the most effective way of teaching new skills to those diagnosed with autism who may not necessarily learn these skills on their own. Applied Behaviour Consultingâ€™s ABA services have been designed to work with the family to provide individualized resources with a focus on achieving specific goals using ABA.
