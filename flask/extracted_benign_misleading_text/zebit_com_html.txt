Like most retailers, Zebit sources goods at wholesale prices and sells them at competitive retail prices. We are committed to keeping our prices competitive and offering 0% interest to every member.
What’s the catch? There isn’t one! Zebit is unlike other financing methods that charge interest. We don’t believe in financing gotchas or bait and switch tactics. When we say no interest or membership fees, we mean it.
Zebit does not pull anything from the major bureaus that affects your FICO score. Zebit does perform a credit check with a third-party, alternative credit reporting agency, but it has no connection with FICO.
