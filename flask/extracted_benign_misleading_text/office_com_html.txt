Welcome to Office
Your place to create, communicate, collaborate, and get great work done.
What is Office 365?
It's the tools you need
Be more creative and achieve what matters with Outlook, OneDrive, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Yammer, and more.
It's always up to date
With an Office 365 subscription, you get the latest Office apps—both the desktop and the online versions—and updates when they happen.
It's on all your devices
On your desktop, on your tablet, and on your phone.* Office 365 + your device + the Internet = productivity wherever you are.
* Yep, all these: Windows devices, Mac, iPad®, iPhone®, and Android™.
It's your great work, in the cloud
OneDrive makes the work you do available to you from anywhere—and to others when you collaborate or share.
And we're here for you
Help at every turn. Email, chat, or call and talk to a real live person.
