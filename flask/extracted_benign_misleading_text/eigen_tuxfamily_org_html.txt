Overview
- Eigen is versatile.
- It supports all matrix sizes, from small fixed-size matrices to arbitrarily large dense matrices, and even sparse matrices.
- It supports all standard numeric types, including std::complex, integers, and is easily extensible to custom numeric types.
- It supports various matrix decompositions and geometry features.
- Its ecosystem of unsupported modules provides many specialized features such as non-linear optimization, matrix functions, a polynomial solver, FFT, and much more.
- Eigen is fast.
- Expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable lazy evaluation, when that is appropriate.
- Explicit vectorization is performed for SSE 2/3/4, AVX, AVX2, FMA, AVX512, ARM NEON (32-bit and 64-bit), PowerPC AltiVec/VSX (32-bit and 64-bit), ZVector (s390x/zEC13) SIMD instruction sets, and since 3.4 MIPS MSA with graceful fallback to non-vectorized code.
- Fixed-size matrices are fully optimized: dynamic memory allocation is avoided, and the loops are unrolled when that makes sense.
- For large matrices, special attention is paid to cache-friendliness.
- Eigen is reliable.
- Algorithms are carefully selected for reliability. Reliability trade-offs are clearly documented and extremely safe decompositions are available.
- Eigen is thoroughly tested through its own test suite (over 500 executables), the standard BLAS test suite, and parts of the LAPACK test suite.
- Eigen is elegant.
- The API is extremely clean and expressive while feeling natural to C++ programmers, thanks to expression templates.
- Implementing an algorithm on top of Eigen feels like just copying pseudocode.
- Eigen has good compiler support as we run our test suite against many compilers to guarantee reliability and work around any compiler bugs. Eigen also is standard C++98 and maintains very reasonable compilation times.
Documentation
- Eigen 3 documentation: this includes a getting started guide, a long tutorial, a quick reference, and page about porting from Eigen 2 to Eigen 3.
- Eigen 2 documentation (old): this includes the Eigen 2 Tutorial.
Requirements
Eigen doesn't have any dependencies other than the C++ standard library.
We use the CMake build system, but only to build the documentation and unit-tests, and to automate installation. If you just want to use Eigen, you can use the header files right away. There is no binary library to link to, and no configured header file. Eigen is a pure template library defined in the headers.
License
Eigen is Free Software. Starting from the 3.1.1 version, it is licensed under the MPL2, which is a simple weak copyleft license. Common questions about the MPL2 are answered in the official MPL2 FAQ.
Earlier versions were licensed under the LGPL3+.
Note that currently, a few features rely on third-party code licensed under the LGPL: SimplicialCholesky, AMD ordering, and constrained_cg. Such features can be explicitly disabled by compiling with the EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY preprocessor symbol defined. Furthermore, Eigen provides interface classes for various third-party libraries (usually recognizable by the <Eigen/*Support> header name). Of course you have to mind the license of the so-included library when using them.
Virtually any software may use Eigen. For example, closed-source software may use Eigen without having to disclose its own source code. Many proprietary and closed-source software projects are using Eigen right now, as well as many BSD-licensed projects.
See the MPL2 FAQ for more information, and do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.
Compiler support
Eigen is standard C++98 and so should theoretically be compatible with any compliant compiler. Whenever we use some non-standard feature, that is optional and can be disabled.
Eigen is being successfully used with the following compilers:
- GCC, version 4.8 and newer. Older versions of gcc might work as well but they are not tested anymore.
- MSVC (Visual Studio), 2012 and newer. Be aware that enabling IntelliSense (/FR flag) is known to trigger some internal compilation errors. The old 3.2 version of Eigen supports MSVC 2010, and the 3.1 version supports MSVC 2008.
- Intel C++ compiler. Enabling the -inline-forceinline option is highly recommended.
- LLVM/CLang++, version 3.4 and newer. (The 2.8 version used to work fine, but it is not tested with up-to-date versions of Eigen)
- XCode 7 and newer. Based on LLVM/CLang.
- MinGW, recent versions. Based on GCC.
- QNX's QCC compiler.
Regarding performance, Eigen performs best with compilers based on GCC or LLVM/Clang. See this page for some known compilation issues.

There is also a private mailing list which should only be used if you want to write privately to a few core developers (it is read by GaÃ«l, Jitse and Christoph). The address is eigen-core-team at the same lists server as for the Eigen mailing list. You do not need to subscribe (actually, subscription is closed). For all Eigen development discussion, use the public mailing list or Bugzilla instead.
IRC Channel
Our IRC channel is #eigen on irc.freenode.net.
Everybody's welcome to discuss Eigen-related topics or just chat. Some quick Eigen development chat happens over IRC, but the main place for Eigen development discussion remains the Eigen mailing list. Some user support also happens over IRC, but the main place for Eigen user support is the Users Forum.
Contributing to Eigen
Eigen is written and maintained by volunteers. You can contribute in many ways to help: give support to new users, write and improve documentation, helping with bugs and other issues in bugzilla, discussing the design and the API, running tests and writing code. See our page on Contributing to Eigen for pointers to get you started.
