GORE-TEX SHAKEDRY™ JACKETS PUT IT ON, LEAVE IT ON!
With the GORE-TEX membrane as the outer surface, water simply beads and runs of, which results in minimal chilling effects or weight gain caused by wetted out garments.

TECHNOLOGY IS MORE THAN THE LATEST INNOVATION
|
At GORE® Wear, as our technology improves so do we. This mindset helps us to stay ahead of the game and to continue to better the lives of athletes no matter the adventure.

In cold seasons, our protective technologies make a difference between surviving the chill and thriving in it. It’s about weather protection against rain, wind, and snow. It’s about reflective materials that shine in the dark. It’s about ventilation while keeping warm. Because no matter what sport you’re passionate about, equip yourself to thrive.
