Coaching is needed in the world today.
So if you're reading this, YOU'RE needed.
From a young age people are told what to do and when, what to learn, what to think and what matters. The rules are set by others. People internalize and follow these rules, forming beliefs around them, falsely believing it's who they are.
It's no wonder so many people feel disconnected from themselves. The skills and techniques that we learn as coaches help our clients develop new ways of being. We help our clients challenge their limiting beliefs - and encourage them to be who they truly are.
So, the world needs coaching, but more importantly the world needs YOU!
Grow your Confidence, Grow your Clients and Grow your Business.
We also know that many coaches struggle to grow their coaching practice. I did too when I started out.
And that's why I developed professional tools for coaching; worksheets and forms that boosted my confidence and offered instant and concrete value to both clients and prospects.
What is a Coaching Tool?
Coaching Tools are forms, worksheets or exercises given to the client to help them move forwards, learn something new or take action. Each coaching tool will cover a specific topic. When a coaching tool is matched to a client's individual situation, it will deepen a client's understanding of themselves, helping them see things differently, learn and make change in their lives. A Coaching Tool is a supplement to the coaching conversation, and can also be used in workshops, groups, webinars and more.
At The Coaching Tools Company, we specialise in practical, tangible and actionable coaching resources for coaches.
When we talk about coaching tools, we mean tangible documents - printable forms that get clients away from technology and more connected to themselves. Our tools for coaching take the form of exercises, forms, worksheets, eBooks and guides.
We also offer social media graphics - coach-specific content to share daily to build fans and followers.
Here's How our Coaching Tools Work:
- Choose your coaching tool, program or toolkit.
- Purchase and receive an immediate download.
- Add your branding to the tools.
- Give the tools to your clients (client instructions included on the tools).
- Add additional value by coaching your clients around the results and going deeper. Then coach clients to choose an action step to solidify their learning or move forwards.
Read our Complete Guide to Life Coaching Tools to learn more about what coaching tools are and how you can use them in your thriving coaching practice.
"I absolutely love, love, love the tools! I've purchased two toolkits, and I love every single tool. They are all very high-quality (both in content and appearance) and easily customizable. They have saved me HOURS of work by having easy-to-access and easy-to-use tools that are very specific to my clients' needs. Truly an invaluable resource that I am thankful and happy to have found."
- Patrina M. Clark, HCS, SPHR, President Pivotal Practices Consulting LLC
Coaching Can be Challenging, Coaching Tools Help!
Coaching as a career is both rewarding and challenging. You get to do meaningful work and help people grow, but you also become a small business owner - an entrepreneur. Moreover, running your own coaching business is extremely hard work. There is so much to do, to learn, and time disappears - fast.
Crucially, done-for-you Coaching Tools, Forms and Exercises save you tons of time and energy, because you don't have to create them yourself.
Most importantly, the ultimate purpose of Coaching Tools is to help clients move forwards, get motivated and commit to action. In addition, when you use tools in coaching they concretize the coaching experience, helping clients (and prospects) see the value of coaching right away.
So, done-for-you coaching exercises save you time, energy and weeks of work. Furthermore, they boost your confidence, allowing you to offer professional pre-prepared forms and exercises to use in coaching sessions, as homework, in workshops and more.

Client Testimonial - about Coaching Tools!
"Her tools are simple, easy to use, and highly effective. What I like most about her coaching and her tools, is that I always walk away with an 'action plan' I can implement right away, from which I start seeing results almost immediately."
- Rishel Tomlinson, Former Client, Mortgage Broker & Owner of Custom Mortgages
Get the benefits of all my hard work without lifting a finger:
I've been coaching since 2003 and I built Simplicity Life Coaching Ltd. from scratch into a successful life coaching business!
Initially I developed Coaching Tools to save time and feel more confident. But then I found there were many extra benefits I didn't expect:
- They make coaching more tangible - something a client can literally grab hold of!
- Coaching Worksheets help you appear professional and organized.
- They make great homework to keep clients engaged between sessions.
- And they make fantastic handouts (walking brochures!) for your workshops and seminars.
It took me years to develop, test and accumulate all these Coaching Worksheets and Toolkits and you get to bypass it all - receiving all the benefits without the hard slog!
But don't believe me - check out our testimonials here and in the boxes below.
"Thanks for all the TOOLS!!! They are fantastic... My clients LOVE the tools and many become serious about their life/business as they work through each of the different TOOLS that I have sent them. Again...thanks!!!"

- 'Doc' Richard R. Eley - Certified Franklin Covey Coach The Lamplighter Coaching
Coaching Tools Boost your Confidence - especially when you're starting out.
If you're already successful it's a full-time job to keep your clients engaged and quality referrals pouring in. Meanwhile, when you're starting out as a coach, it can be really challenging to demonstrate value to your potential clients.
Our tools for coaching help both new and established coaches:
- Save time and energy developing and testing your own coaching worksheets so you can focus on important things like expanding your business and coaching clients!
- Keep your coaching fresh - with a constant stream of new ideas and exciting resources.
- Provide continuity and a bridge between sessions - your clients achieve more because they stay longer in a coaching frame of mind.
- Create inspiring and fun workshops with helpful handouts.
- Always have something ready to do with prospects or clients when they come to a session with vague requests or unclear objectives.
"I love The Coaching Tools Company! I began using some of the free resources in my workshops, and after I received such rave reviews on the exercises and activities I downloaded, I went ahead and made my first of many purchases from The Coaching Tools Company. The participants in my workshop love the activity and exercises, and what's even better is that many of the attendees actually signed up for individual sessions with me! How exciting, and it's thanks to your amazing tools."
- Collette Gee - Certified Neuro-Lingustic Practitioner and Holistic Coach Finding Happily
Coaching Tools and Exercises are a vastly underused resource in the coaching world...
These coaching tools provide a foundation that helps you:
- Stand out! Add a polished, clearly tangible yet lighthearted framework to your coaching practice.
- Have super-productive coaching sessions and workshops.
- Help your clients identify blocks and come up with new ideas - faster - which they then bring to you to delve deeper and work your coaching magic.
- Make it easier to attract more new clients, increase prospect conversion rates and inspire your existing clients to rave about you.

Emma-Louise’s coaching tools create a context around the work I do with my clients – a structure and foundation that pulls everything together and helps to anchor results.

Coaching Tools also add a lighthearted and fun element to the often challenging coaching process.
Let's face it, to get real results our clients have to work hard! They have to put effort into overcoming self-sabotaging behaviours, and take additional action when they're already busy!
Yet we all know that when things are fun people are more engaged, they achieve more, learn faster and the learning is stickier! And, of course, engaged clients refer to us more and stay with us longer...
These Powerful Coaching Tools do Quadruple duty:
- Supercharge your coaching sessions
- Inspiring client homework
- Use for a professional welcome packet
- Handout in your webinars, seminars or workshops.
Coaching Tools also help you shine in prospect and corporate meetings - by demonstrating what coaching is in a clearly tangible way.

"When I discovered The Coaching Tools Company website I knew I had found a gold mine. I think Emma-Louise's Toolkits are professional, creative and a great time saver. Using these sheets I've been able to add immense value to the people I work with by providing fun and meaningful "in-between session" work and also using her sheets as a guide during sessions to go deeper. Because these forms are specific to coaching and 'ready to go' I can focus on what I love to do and that's Coach - without needing to use creative energy and time elsewhere. Thanks Emma-Louise!"

Now I just have to add a couple of points to tailor it to my youth coaching niche and it's saved me hours and hours of work! Thanks Emma-Louise."
