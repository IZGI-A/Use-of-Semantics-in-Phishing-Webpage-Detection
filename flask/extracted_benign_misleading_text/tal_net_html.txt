Tal.net simplifies your job search by enabling you to re-use your data in future applications.
You can use Tal.net to create a single registration that can be used to quickly apply to many of Oleeo Plc’s clients and top employers.
All your data is stored to enable future re-use. Currently, you can re-use registration data (username, password, first name and last name). Additional data sets such as education, work experience, and achievements are in the process of being added to the re-usable data set.

Once you’ve taken the tests, we’ll email you feedback on your performance, helping you to prepare for those all important job applications. Click here to access the tests.
