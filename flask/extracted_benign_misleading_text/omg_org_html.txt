We see membership in OMG as a privilege, enabling our thought leaders to help define some of the most important standards applied in today’s international software industry. OMG also provides the opportunity for us to work with partners, competitors, customers, prospects and academics, giving us highly valuable industry knowledge and contacts, ultimately delivering real business benefits.
Cory Casanave, CEO, President, Model Driven Solutions
Besides the travel opportunities, the OMG offers a unique way to interact with peers and experts in a way that is simply not possible within the typical enterprise or with vendors. The OMG offers access to others solving similar problems as well as industry thought leaders in a collaborative atmosphere. Users’ needs and perspectives then get factored into standards and products through both the formal and cultural processes.
Gary Duncanson, President & CEO, No Magic, Inc.
It goes without saying that our team’s work with OMG has made a significant impact on our company’s direction and presence in the industry. In many respects our Board, Chair, Co-Chair and working group involvement has enabled No Magic and the solutions we develop, to be grounded in OMG industry standards. This adherence to standards is seen as critical to success in the competitive environment we face today and tomorrow.
Sridhar Iyengar, Distinguished Engineer, TJ Watson Research Center, IBM
Over the last 20 years, OMG has extended its roots from developing standards in Middleware (CORBA) to Application Design (UML) and more recently Business Process Management (BPMN), Enterprise Architecture (UPDMTM) and Case Management. This flexibility to shape standards in key technologies and industries using its strength in modeling standards is a key reason why IBM, our partners and customers are at OMG and implementing many of these standards in our products.
