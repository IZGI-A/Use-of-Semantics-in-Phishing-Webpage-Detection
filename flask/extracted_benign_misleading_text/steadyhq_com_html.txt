The future for independent media and creative professionals
Steady enables us to support the projects we cannot do without, from independent media to podcasts, videos to open source code. Because good work deserves more than a like.
Membership Revolution
[ mem-ber-ship rev-uh-loo-shuhn ] / movement
Memberships are the key to a media landscape filled with diverse, independent voices. Members offer sustainable support for projects and personalities, not because they have to, but because they want to. Members are more loyal and committed than subscribers. And members liberate media. Join the membership revolution!

You have the community
Your community loves you for the work you do. You’d be surprised how many people want to support you.

The experience of hundreds of projects
We’re independent publishers ourselves. That's why we built Steady. Everything we’ve learned about memberships we share with you.
Our publishers speak for themselves
“I spent weeks researching and found that Steady was the best solution … It feels like Steady just keeps growing, as there’s always something happening and it gets faster all the time. I’d say that’s the Steady effect.”
“After spending months preparing our campaign, nothing on the market made more sense for us. The team is helpful and always around for support and good advice.”
“Steady is extremely user-friendly, both for potential supporters and publishers themselves. On top of that, the level of personal support was fantastic.”

Your project is the star, not Steady
