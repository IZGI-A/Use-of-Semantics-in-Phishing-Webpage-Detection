After doing much research and actually purchasing another program, we are currently using Paperless Pipeline. We like that it is simple to use and easy to learn. Our agents embraced it and are thrilled with the convenience of having everything in one place that is accessible from anywhere.- Leslie MyersDirector of OperationsJ.P.
