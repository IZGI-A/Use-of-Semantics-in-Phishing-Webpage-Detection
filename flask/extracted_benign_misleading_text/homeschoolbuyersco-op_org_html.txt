Why we're here:
School districts get huge discounts on their curriculum. Why not homeschoolers? The reason is simple: school districts have purchasing power and homeschoolers don't because we purchase as individuals. The Homeschool Buyers Co-op changes that for homeschoolers everywhere.
What we provide:
We save you 20%-90% on your homeschool curriculum. By pooling the purchasing power of our entire membership, we are able to call major educational publishers and homeschooling curriculum providers and negotiate much better prices for our members than they can get on their own. And it works! Virtually every vendor will give discounts for their homeschool curriculum if they are assured adequate volumes.
How we do it:
How do we get the volumes needed for affordable homeschooling programs? We do it through a unique process called a "GroupBuy". Essentially, we negotiate volume discounts with the homeschool curriculum publishers, then put an offer out to our members that says, for example, "Hey, Co-opers, you can get 20% off for this homeschool curriculum if you purchase by the end of the month, but if we get 20 members to sign up, everybody will get 30% off, and if 50 members sign up, everybody will get 40% off and so on." Once the GroupBuy is complete, we are often able to lock in those GroupBuy savings and offer them year-round.
