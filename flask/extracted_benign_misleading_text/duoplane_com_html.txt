How does it work?
- Your customer places an order on your site.
- Duoplane automatically imports the order.
- Based on rules that you've set, Duoplane separates the order's items into one or more vendor purchase orders.
- Duoplane sends the purchase orders to the correct vendors or warehouses. POs can be sent by email or FTP in any of a number of different formats (e.g. PDF, CSV, XML files) and on a variety of custom schedules.
- Once a vendor receives a purchase order, they can use your Vendor Portal to confirm the PO, send you a message about the order, or download a branded packing slip that has been customized with your logo and policies.
- After the purchase order ships, your vendor or you upload or enter tracking information. Duoplane can also automatically retrieve tracking information if the order was shipped on your UPS or FedEx account.
- Duoplane transmits the tracking number to your cart software to indicate that that part of the order has shipped.
- With our optional accounting sync, Duoplane can also export vendor invoices to your accounting system.
