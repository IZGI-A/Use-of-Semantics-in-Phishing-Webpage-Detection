Year: 2012
Runtime: 3 hr 53 minDirector Alison Ellwood, along with Producer (and Academy Award-winning documentarian), Alex Gibney, meticulously crafts an intimate patchwork of rare archival material, concert footage, and unseen home movies exploring the evolution and enduring popularity of one of America's truly definitive bands. Inspired by the vibrant Los Angeles music scene, Glenn Frey and Don Henley left Linda Ronstadt's backup band in 1971 to team with Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner and form the Eagles. While personal stories from band members (later including Don Felder, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit), managers, and music-industry luminaries frame the narrative, it's the unexpected moments-recording sessions, backstage interactions, and even a whimsical sequence from the Desperado cover shoot-that convey the extraordinary bond linking artists, music, and the times (an era when country-tinged rock and finely-honed harmonies spoke to a nation still reeling from unrest). But the band was not impervious to its own unrest, and its conflicts prompted several departures and ultimately led to its demise (or long vacation). Part One follows the band from its formation in 1971 through its ascendancy in the 70's to the infamous unravelling in the fall of 1980. Part Two tracks the group from its reunion in 1994 through the triumphant Hell Freezes Over tour, the 2007 release of the album, The Long Road Out of Eden (which sold over 5-1/2 million copies, worldwide, and garnered the band its 5th and 6th GrammyR Awards), and its ongoing success as an international touring act. This history of the Eagles skips neither a beat nor a hit song, and we're reminded why the band's greatest hits collection (Vol. I) remains the best-selling album of the 20th century. - John Nein, Sundance Institute

Eight Days A Week: The Touring Years
Year: 2016
Runtime: 1 hr 46 minIn 1962 four young men - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr - came together to form the 20th century musical phenomenon known as 'The Beatles'. The band stormed Europe in 1963 and, in 1964, they conquered America. Their groundbreaking world tours changed global youth culture forever and, arguably, invented mass entertainment as we know it today. All the while, the group were composing and recording a series of extraordinarily successful singles and albums. However, the relentless pressure of such unprecedented fame (which in 1966 became uncontrollable turmoil) led to the decision to stop touring. In the ensuing years The Beatles were then free to focus on a series of albums that changed the face of recorded music. Master storyteller and Oscar winner, Ron Howard, explores this incredible journey in his own unique way: How did The Beatles do this? How did they cope with all the fame and pressure? How did they not only survive, but go on to revolutionise popular music? With original interviews, footage, staggering live performances, and the intimate study of character that Ron Howard is known for, he puts us right inside this extraordinary adventure, answering the question everyone always wants to know: What was it like to be there?

Runtime: 50 minThe story of the making of this remarkable album is told here via exclusive interviews with band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett and Jason Newsted, archive footage and performance, and contributions from producer Bob Rock. Featuring the five singles from the album, Enter Sandman, Sad But True, "The Unforgiven", "Wherever I May Roam" and "Nothing Else Matters", this is the compelling story of one of the biggest selling albums of all time, a true Classic Album.
"The making and continued influence of Metallica's commercial breakthrough (known simply as "the Black Album") is entertainingly recounted in this must for Metallica fanatics, especially those who are interested in the recording of one of hard rock's most sonically breathtaking albums. Drummer Lars Ulrich, singer James Hetfield, and producer Bob Rock take up the lion's share of the interviews, and their reminiscences a decade after the fact include many juicy tidbits (like Ulrich and Rock loathing each other by the time the recording was finished, or that the final mix was nearly ruined by a digital clicking sound on the master tape--luckily, a successful remastering was done).

Runtime: 1 hr 27 minL7: Pretend We're Dead takes us on an all-access journey into the 1990's grunge movement that took the world by storm, and the band that helped define it as the genre of a generation. Culled from over 100 hours of vintage home movies taken by the band, never-before-seen performance footage, and candid interviews, L7: Pretend We're Dead is an engrossing time capsule told from the perspective of L7, these true insiders who brought their signature blend of grunge punk to the masses! Chronicling the early days of the band's formation in 1985 to their height as the 'queens of grunge,' the film takes a roller coaster ride through L7's triumphs and failures, providing never-before-discussed insight into the band's eventual dissolution in 2001. Formed by Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner-guitars/vocals, the band completed their lineup with the addition of Jennifer Finch on bass/vocals and Dee Plakas on drums. To highlight the fact that L7 was an all-female group, however, was to miss the point. "Our fans couldn't give a shit if we're women," Sparks says. "We did not set out to be an all-girl band. It just happened that way." Yet the "gender issue" would return time and again for the band; from shock jocks refusing to play "chick rock" to academics accusing the band of "incorrectly" embracing their feminism to hard rock press implying the band was merely riding a wave of "girl power" trendiness. Despite these obstacles, L7: Pretend We're Dead shows the thread of influence the band had not only on rock and roll but on future generations of women everywhere and is, at the end, a testament to the pioneering spirit of a band that refuses to take anything lying down. "They can't hear a word we said, when we pretend that we're dead" Also includes the infamous 1997 documentary "L7 The Beauty Process" that was directed by Krist Novoselic.

Runtime: 1 hr 34 minOzzy Osbourne is one of the most iconic figures in rock and one of the founding fathers of heavy metal, however to many his “Madman” persona has overshadowed his considerable musical achievements. “God Bless Ozzy Osbourne” tells for the first time the story of his career from the founding of Black Sabbath through to solo stardom and his wider fame beyond. These were the wild days of his prodigious drug and alcohol intake, of biting the head from a dove at a record company meeting and biting into a bat on stage but also of the tragic death of Randy Rhoads and the reality TV show The Osbournes. The film follows Ozzy’s torturous and emotionally fraught journey from excess to sobriety, which Ozzy regards as his greatest accomplishment. Featuring never before seen footage, new interviews with Ozzy himself, his brothers and sisters, his children, his bandmates in Black Sabbath and those who both inspired him and were inspired by him, this is the first film to take viewers inside the mind and psyche of this legendary figure.

Year: 2007
Runtime: 2 hr 16 minLeave it to My Chemical Romance to call their second full live album — and their second live release during The Black Parade era — The Black Parade Is Dead! Unlike 2007's mini-album Live and Rare, which patched together performances from MCR's fall 2006/winter 2007 dates in the U.K. and Europe, The Black Parade Is Dead! is a lavish CD/DVD affair chronicling two performances: the CD captures the band's October 7, 2007, Mexico City date — their last as the Black Parade — while the DVD features video of that show as well as their October 24, 2007, date at Maxwell's in their home state of New Jersey. The Black Parade Is Dead!'s grandiosity is only fitting, considering how elaborate The Black Parade was, and also fittingly, the Mexico City show is a song-for-song performance of that album — the only difference is "The Black Parade Is Dead," where Gerard Way announces to the audience that this is "the last performance of The Black Parade forever!"

Gory, sexually perverse, and scatological in the extreme, GWAR were formed at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond as an experiment in marketing strategy by several musicians, art students, and dancers. The group claimed to consist of all-powerful interplanetary warriors, descended from aliens stranded in Antarctica and initially created from the lowest filth in the universe, who came to Earth to sexually enslave and/or slaughter the human race.

Runtime: 54 minWhen glam-rock took over the 70s music scene, Led Zeppelin danced to their own tune. Turning out wilder, raunchier and more powerful sounds on Rock classics like "Stairway to Heaven" and "Whole Lotta Love". With the dynamic vocals of Robert Plant, the mesmerizing guitar and bass of Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, and the magnificent drumming of John Bonham, Led Zeppelin had a line-up that would rock on, or so it seemed, forever. But like so many rock legends, they found that there was a high price to pay for living life in the fast lane. When Bonham died tragically in 1980, Led Zeppelin was disbanded, as the remaining members hadn't the heart to continue without the "Big Guy" on drums. The fact that more than 30 years down the line, the music of Led Zeppelin lives on, is a testament to the power of their music. Presented by former artist manager from London's famous Tin Pan Alley, Liam Dale, "On the Rock Trail" takes you on an informative (and at times humorous) journey behind the scenes of these icons of the music industry. This documentary contains no music from Led Zeppelin and is not authorized by Led Zeppelin or any of their affiliate entities.

Down The Tracks -The Music That Influenced Led Zeppelin
Year: 2006
Runtime: 1 hr 32 minAs recent events have proven, Led Zeppelin continues to be one of the biggest bands of all time.

Eight Days A Week: The Touring Years
Year: 2016
Runtime: 1 hr 46 minIn 1962 four young men - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr - came together to form the 20th century musical phenomenon known as 'The Beatles'. The band stormed Europe in 1963 and, in 1964, they conquered America. Their groundbreaking world tours changed global youth culture forever and, arguably, invented mass entertainment as we know it today. All the while, the group were composing and recording a series of extraordinarily successful singles and albums. However, the relentless pressure of such unprecedented fame (which in 1966 became uncontrollable turmoil) led to the decision to stop touring. In the ensuing years The Beatles were then free to focus on a series of albums that changed the face of recorded music. Master storyteller and Oscar winner, Ron Howard, explores this incredible journey in his own unique way: How did The Beatles do this? How did they cope with all the fame and pressure? How did they not only survive, but go on to revolutionise popular music? With original interviews, footage, staggering live performances, and the intimate study of character that Ron Howard is known for, he puts us right inside this extraordinary adventure, answering the question everyone always wants to know: What was it like to be there?

Year: 1977
Runtime: 1 hr 22 minThe Rolling Stones 1978 tour of the USA in support of that year’s “Some Girls” album is considered by fans to be one of their very best. The tour followed immediately on the release of the “Some Girls” album and by the time the band arrived in Texas in mid-July the album had hit the No.1 spot on the US charts. The tour took a “back to basics” approach, with the band and their music very much at the forefront and little or no elaborate staging. Filmed at the Will Rogers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas, on 18 July 1978, this concert is typical of the tour with the Rolling Stones delivering a raw, energetic performance in front of a crowd who are clearly loving the show. Many of the tracks from “Some Girls” are included in the live set with a sprinkling of Stones classics from earlier albums. Originally shot on 16mm film, the footage has been carefully restored and the sound remixed and remastered by Bob Clearmountain from the original multitrack tapes.

Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970

Runtime: 1 hr 6 minAugust, 1970: With Jim Morrison's ongoing Miami obscenity trial casting an ominous shadow over the band, The Doors flew to England to play the Isle of Wight Festival. Waiting for them at "The Last Great Festival" were over 600,000 fans who had already torn down the barriers, crashed the gates, and enjoyed performances by the world's top acts such as Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Miles Davis and Joni Mitchell. The Doors took the stage at 2 am, playing with the weight of the trial on their backs, and showed fans they still had the magic that had propelled them to the top during the Summer of Love. "We played with a controlled fury and Jim was in fine vocal form," said Doors organist Ray Manzarek. "He sang for all he was worth, but moved nary a muscle. Dionysus had been shackled." Less than a year later, The Doors were no more. Here, for the very first time, is the last Doors concert ever filmed. The Doors: Live at the Isle of Wight.

Director Lance Bangs - who has made videos for the Arcade Fire, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Sonic Youth as well as directing R.E.M.'s Road Movie - keeps his small camera crew focused on the stage, getting up close and sweaty with guitarist-singer Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney. Occasionally, he'll pull back to acknowledge the head-bobbing crowd pressed close to the stage, their hands reaching out to Auerbach. There are no visual pyrotechnics, no elaborate editing, no backstage cutaways, yet the show is riveting from start to finish and the feel of the music in that room is nothing less than triumphant.

Year: 1997
Runtime: 1 hr 46 minThe Dance finds Fleetwood Mac rekindling their late ‘70s magic on stage with mostly successful results. Old friends and sparring partners Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie harmonize and take turns in the spotlight, backed as before by the sturdy rhythm section of John McVie and Mick Fleetwood. Performing in a stripped-down format, the group reconsiders its past with a sense of perspective — Nicks in particular adds something new to signature songs like “Rhiannon” and “Landslide.” Buckingham acquits himself well on the always odd “Tusk” as well as such fresh tunes as the ferocious “My Little Demon” and the Appalachian-accented “Bleed to Love Her.” Christine McVie acts as a leavening force, rippling sweetly through “Say You Love Me” and gliding high on the new “Temporary One.” If there’s a centerpiece to this set, it’s Nicks’ “Silver Springs,” a devastating break-up ballad denied a spot on the Mac’s landmark Rumours album. The inevitable (but still welcome) “Don’t Stop” brings the set to a rousing conclusion.

Year: 2009
Runtime: 1 hr"Live In London" is a live performance masterpiece that captures The Pretenders at the top of their game. If you saw them live on their 2009 tour, you'll know what I'm talking about. You owe it to yourself to get this program as a reminder of just how amazing this band is on the road.
"Live In London" succeeds where The Pretenders' studio albums fail. They are one of those rare bands that truly does sound better when they're playing in front of an audience -- an intimate small theater crowd here.
With all due respect to original guitarist James Honeyman Scott and bassist Pete Farndon, The Pretenders latest lineup is the best Chrissie Hynde has ever staged. With the steady pounding of original drummer Martin Chambers, newcomers James Walbourne on guitar, Nick Wilkinson on bass and Eric Heywood on pedal steel rock from start to finish, revitalizing Pretenders' classics like "Message of Love" and "Kid," while adding new ones like "Boots of Chinese Plastic" to the playlist.
You'll be blown away by Walbourne's electrifying guitar work. It starts with the first licks of the opener "Chinese Plastic," scorches through "Rosalee," and climaxes with the show-stopper "Precious." Walbourne delivers pure, unadulterated, raw, rip-snorting rock 'n' roll. His on-stage chemistry with Hynde is self-evident.
As per usual, Hynde's vocals are impeccable, showing great range, dynamics and emotion, equally adept at punk rockers like "The Wait" and ballads like "I'll Stand By You." This woman has earned the right to work the stage with the swagger of a rock star. She is it.
The direction and camera work throughout "Live In London" give the viewer the perspective of being on stage with The Pretenders. Tight crops interspersed with effective wide angles make one feel like he can count the streaks of mascara multiplying on Hynde's face and see the beads of sweat building on Chambers' brow as the night rocks on.

Runtime: 1 hr 4 minIn the words of Ben Fong-Torres:
Etta James, who passed away in 2012, was such a magnetic singer and presence that she was a semi-regular at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, which is pretty selective about its bills. After her crack band opens with a couple, including “Hold On, I’m Coming,” James kills on “I’d Rather Go Blind,” “I Just Wanna Make Love to You,” and several more. “Come to Mama,” indeed!
Etta James made many appearances at the Montreux Jazz Festival across her long and distinguished career from her first concert in 1975 through to her last in 2008. This film focuses on the concert from 1993 when she was at her absolute peak and complements it with selected tracks from many other Montreux appearances. It features many of her best loved tracks and songs that she is particularly associated with. Etta James was one of the most respected performers of her generation. In a career stretching over 60 years she was inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall Of Fame and the Blues Hall Of Fame, won 3 Grammys and received many more nominations and was named Female Blues Artist Of The Year on no less than 14 occasions. Sadly, Etta James passed away after a long illness in January 2012 and this film is a fitting tribute to one of the greatest female vocalists of the 20th century.

Born on Christmas Day in 1984, Jess and Lisa first performed as the Origliasso Twins, and their appearances at awards shows and sporting events drew the attention of agents and talent agencies. As teenagers, the twins released three teen pop albums under the name Lisa & Jessica, and they began making forays into TV after landing recurring roles in the Australian children's series Cybergirl. After Jess received a guitar as a birthday present in 2002, though, the girls started devoting more time to songwriting, gradually transforming their sound from pop to alternative rock in the process.

Runtime: 1 hr"Live In London" is a live performance masterpiece that captures The Pretenders at the top of their game. If you saw them live on their 2009 tour, you'll know what I'm talking about. You owe it to yourself to get this program as a reminder of just how amazing this band is on the road.
"Live In London" succeeds where The Pretenders' studio albums fail. They are one of those rare bands that truly does sound better when they're playing in front of an audience -- an intimate small theater crowd here.
With all due respect to original guitarist James Honeyman Scott and bassist Pete Farndon, The Pretenders latest lineup is the best Chrissie Hynde has ever staged. With the steady pounding of original drummer Martin Chambers, newcomers James Walbourne on guitar, Nick Wilkinson on bass and Eric Heywood on pedal steel rock from start to finish, revitalizing Pretenders' classics like "Message of Love" and "Kid," while adding new ones like "Boots of Chinese Plastic" to the playlist.
You'll be blown away by Walbourne's electrifying guitar work. It starts with the first licks of the opener "Chinese Plastic," scorches through "Rosalee," and climaxes with the show-stopper "Precious." Walbourne delivers pure, unadulterated, raw, rip-snorting rock 'n' roll. His on-stage chemistry with Hynde is self-evident.
As per usual, Hynde's vocals are impeccable, showing great range, dynamics and emotion, equally adept at punk rockers like "The Wait" and ballads like "I'll Stand By You." This woman has earned the right to work the stage with the swagger of a rock star. She is it.
The direction and camera work throughout "Live In London" give the viewer the perspective of being on stage with The Pretenders. Tight crops interspersed with effective wide angles make one feel like he can count the streaks of mascara multiplying on Hynde's face and see the beads of sweat building on Chambers' brow as the night rocks on.

Runtime: 59 minEnsiferum was founded in 1995 by Markus Toivonen (guitar), Sauli Savolainen (bass) and Kimmo Miettinen (drums). For the band's name, they took the Latin neuter gender adjective ensiferum, which means "sword bearer". In the next year, Jari was taken into the band as singer and second guitar-player. In 1997, the first demo was released, containing three songs.
The highly stylized logo of Ensiferum has appeared on all of their releases.
In 1998, Sauli and Kimmo left the band and were replaced by Jukka-Pekka Miettinen (Kimmo's little brother, then 14 years old) and Oliver Fokin. In January 1999, a second demo was recorded, which although it did not produce a recording deal, boosted the band's confidence. In November 1999 a third demo, "Hero in a Dream", was recorded, which was successful in obtaining a record deal with Spinefarm Records. The logo that appears on all the bands releases was designed for the third demo by Tuomas Tahvanainen, who also designed the logos for the earlier demos. In 2000, the band went into the studio to work on their first album, Ensiferum, which was released in August 2001. In the same year, Meiju Enho joined them as a keyboard-player.

Runtime: 53 minIt may have taken a few years for Boston act All That Remains to make an impact on the metalcore scene, but with the release of their third full-length effort The Fall Of Ideals in 2006, All That Remains not only finally found the right balance of melody and aggression, but they also found a whole new audience, with the album easily outselling their previous efforts.
After a brief introduction and some pre-show footage of various fans screaming the bands name, All That Remains quite literally destroy with Become The Catalyst, The Air That I Breathe, Not Alone, It Dwells In Me, Six, This Calling, The Weak Willed and Indictment, all of which are lifted from The Fall Of Ideals.
The remaining four tracks This Darkened Heart, For Salvation, Tattered On My Sleeve and Focus Shall Not Fail are lifted from 2004s This Darkened Heart and seamlessly blend in with the groups more recent material without clashing too much.
All That Remains performance is near flawless, while the editing together of the multiple camera angles (Filmed by the renown High Roller Studios) retains the energy and excitement of the performance and the crowd participation perfectly. Audio wise, mixer Jason Suecof has managed to keep a raw edge to the bands sound, which gives All That Remains Live a very real live feel.
All up, All That Remains Live is a rock solid package that shows exactly why All That Remains are considered one of the better metalcore acts doing the circuit today. Highly recommended.

Runtime: 3 hr 53 minDirector Alison Ellwood, along with Producer (and Academy Award-winning documentarian), Alex Gibney, meticulously crafts an intimate patchwork of rare archival material, concert footage, and unseen home movies exploring the evolution and enduring popularity of one of America's truly definitive bands. Inspired by the vibrant Los Angeles music scene, Glenn Frey and Don Henley left Linda Ronstadt's backup band in 1971 to team with Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner and form the Eagles. While personal stories from band members (later including Don Felder, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit), managers, and music-industry luminaries frame the narrative, it's the unexpected moments-recording sessions, backstage interactions, and even a whimsical sequence from the Desperado cover shoot-that convey the extraordinary bond linking artists, music, and the times (an era when country-tinged rock and finely-honed harmonies spoke to a nation still reeling from unrest). But the band was not impervious to its own unrest, and its conflicts prompted several departures and ultimately led to its demise (or long vacation). Part One follows the band from its formation in 1971 through its ascendancy in the 70's to the infamous unravelling in the fall of 1980. Part Two tracks the group from its reunion in 1994 through the triumphant Hell Freezes Over tour, the 2007 release of the album, The Long Road Out of Eden (which sold over 5-1/2 million copies, worldwide, and garnered the band its 5th and 6th GrammyR Awards), and its ongoing success as an international touring act. This history of the Eagles skips neither a beat nor a hit song, and we're reminded why the band's greatest hits collection (Vol. I) remains the best-selling album of the 20th century. - John Nein, Sundance Institute

Runtime: 1 hr 44 minToto may be past its prime as a multi-platinum recording band, but Live in Amsterdam offers abundant proof that their performances are as electrifying as ever. Recorded in Amsterdam's Heineken Music Hall on February 17, 2003, near the end of Toto's 25th anniversary world tour, this dynamic concert serves as a cheerful reminder that Toto have been alive and well and recording steadily since 1978. The band's 2002 release Through the Looking Glass was an album of covers, two of which are welcomed here: "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" is a prime showcase for guitarist Steve Lukather, and "Bodhisattva" is a tight, meticulous tribute to Toto's original drummer, the late Jeff Porcaro, and his classic sessions with Steely Dan. The mega-hits "Africa," "Rosanna," and "Hold the Line" are perfectly executed, and in a band full of talented singers, lead vocalist Bobby Kimball sounds better than ever. Two impressive medleys show the band in full gear as a comfortable unit of seasoned professionals, highlighted by impeccable work from keyboardist David Paich, bassist Mike Poracaro, and ace drummer Simon Phillips (who also produced and mixed this recording for this program). And while 35 minutes of Porcaro's backstage home-video might seem frivolous, it shows a band that's still having fun, as reflected in the beaming smiles of their appreciative Amsterdam audience.

Old friends and sparring partners Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie harmonize and take turns in the spotlight, backed as before by the sturdy rhythm section of John McVie and Mick Fleetwood. Performing in a stripped-down format, the group reconsiders its past with a sense of perspective — Nicks in particular adds something new to signature songs like “Rhiannon” and “Landslide.” Buckingham acquits himself well on the always odd “Tusk” as well as such fresh tunes as the ferocious “My Little Demon” and the Appalachian-accented “Bleed to Love Her.” Christine McVie acts as a leavening force, rippling sweetly through “Say You Love Me” and gliding high on the new “Temporary One.” If there’s a centerpiece to this set, it’s Nicks’ “Silver Springs,” a devastating break-up ballad denied a spot on the Mac’s landmark Rumours album. The inevitable (but still welcome) “Don’t Stop” brings the set to a rousing conclusion.

Runtime: 54 minWhen glam-rock took over the 70s music scene, Led Zeppelin danced to their own tune. Turning out wilder, raunchier and more powerful sounds on Rock classics like "Stairway to Heaven" and "Whole Lotta Love". With the dynamic vocals of Robert Plant, the mesmerizing guitar and bass of Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, and the magnificent drumming of John Bonham, Led Zeppelin had a line-up that would rock on, or so it seemed, forever. But like so many rock legends, they found that there was a high price to pay for living life in the fast lane. When Bonham died tragically in 1980, Led Zeppelin was disbanded, as the remaining members hadn't the heart to continue without the "Big Guy" on drums. The fact that more than 30 years down the line, the music of Led Zeppelin lives on, is a testament to the power of their music. Presented by former artist manager from London's famous Tin Pan Alley, Liam Dale, "On the Rock Trail" takes you on an informative (and at times humorous) journey behind the scenes of these icons of the music industry.
