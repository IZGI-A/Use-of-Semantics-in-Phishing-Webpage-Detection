Who We Are
In 2020 Wickham is an inner city suburb of Newcastle. It has an easy lifestyle; located on the beautiful harbour. Wickham is a scenic stroll around Newcastle. Allowing you to enjoy city views, ocean pools, beaches, the foreshore, coastal parks, with restaurants, pubs, clubs and playgrounds. You can ride a bike, skateboard, roller blade, stand-up paddleboard or dragonboat around the waterfront.
Great Lifestyle Of Wickham is working positively with planned renewal of the village. Modern city living is merging with an urban village from the 1800s.
Revitalisation is occurring, across the harbourside.
GLOW is committed to a comfortable, community with walkable access around the second biggest city in NSW.
