Welcome to the Alaskan Malamute Club of Wisconsin web site. Here you will find information about the Alaskan Malamute including health issues, as well as information about our activities, rescue program, and upcoming events.
The Alaskan Malamute Club of Wisconsin, Inc. was started in 1969 by a group of people interested in the promotion of the true image of the Alaskan Malamute. It is felt that the breed can be promoted and advanced through sharing of knowledge between club members.
