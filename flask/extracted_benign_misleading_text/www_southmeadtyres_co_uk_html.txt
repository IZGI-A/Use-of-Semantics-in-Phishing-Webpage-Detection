What our customers think
“Went to change my punctured tyre on the 5th May, Upon checking, they also identified one of my tyres we're not fit for travelling, I didn't notice until they pointed out, as the tyre tread depth was almost non-existent, fair pricing, and really helpful staff. ”
“I would just like to say thank you . What lovely staff , who provide an excellent , reasonably priced service . I needed my punctured tyres sorting before going to the airport, and you pulled out all the stops . Again thank you . I will definitely recommend you guys ??”
“Because even though I was only booked in for a tyre change, they also checked my brakes (and blow the brake dust out) and checked the threads on my wheel nuts which where cross threaded and at no extra cost they changed them..”
