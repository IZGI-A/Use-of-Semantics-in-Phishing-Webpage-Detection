A few months ago, Liam, 3, was airlifted to CHOC Children’s after the tumor in his brain began to hemorrhage.
It was determined that he had grade IV glioblastoma and had to undergo surgery with CHOC’s Neurosurgery team to have the tumor removed. But because the tumor was already in a complicated area of the brain, Liam’s motor skills on his left side were affected.
Liam began seeing Leesha, physical therapist at CHOC, to help improve movement in his left arm and leg while also undergoing chemotherapy.
Leesha visits Liam five times a week while he is inpatient. Together, they work on things like sitting up on the edge of the bed, standing and peddling on a tricycle.
“My role is to give Liam quality and ability to play despite all the procedures he must endure and to help negate the side effects of medical treatment,” says Leesha.
Liam has improved greatly since seeing Leesha. When he first began physical therapy, he was unable to hold his head up, use his hands, smile or speak. Now, he is able to sit without support, use his right hand and give the cutest smile.
“Liam adores and truly loves Leesha,” says Tracy, Liam’s mom. “When she walks into the door, he has a huge smile and is always willing to do PT with her."
Our physical therapists are also here for the parents to help them continue the progress at home and even help assist in day-to-day activities.
“While Liam was in the PICU attached to multiple lines, one of our first goals was for mom to be able to hold him,” says Leesha. “As physical therapists, we can help facilitate and support that activity."
Liam is currently on his third cycle of chemotherapy and is expected to go through two more. Throughout that time, he will continue inpatient physical therapy so he can get stronger, gain motor skills and reach his full potential.
We’re all rooting for you, Liam!
