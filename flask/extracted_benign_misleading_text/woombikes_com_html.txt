IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE!
Nothing is more important to us than the safety of your child.
Unfortunately, we have become aware that in a small number of bikes from certain product series the shaft of the fork can become loose. This problem affects only the woom ORIGINAL bikes in sizes 4, 5 and 6 with height-adjustable Vario stems sold from September 2018. In order to prevent this problem from occurring, we kindly ask all affected customers to attach an easy-to-install nut and bolt to the bike.
This is a precautionary measure to eliminate even the smallest risk.
"These bicycles are developed to help children's confidence. The low weight and the components are just for little ones! My daughter Mia is flying with her bike!"
"My children ride woom bikes because their lightweight design makes a huge difference."
"My daughter Surya had her first experience on a bike with her woom balance bike. It was the perfect introduction to the wonderful world of cycling."
"My son Teo's first bike was a woom - and his second was a woom too. No prizes for guessing what his third bike is going to be!"

The lightest series-production children's bike in the world
Lightweight and easy peasy. How important is weight when it comes to learning to ride? We have a simple comparison: a child learning to ride on a standard kids' bike is like an adult learning to ride a bike on a moped.
