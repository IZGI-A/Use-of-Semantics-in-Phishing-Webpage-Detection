Immerse yourself in a game of clever planning, careful allocation of power, diplomacy, and the exciting flavor of A Song of Ice and Fire.
"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground." - Cersei Lannister
Apart from the large strategy portion there are also a bit of diplomacy and some intriguing skills required to win the game. So prepare and find a way to conquer the Iron Throne!
And by the way... Please support FFG and buy this great game!
