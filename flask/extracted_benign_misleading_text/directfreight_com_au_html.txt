Direct Freight Express Celebrates 25th Anniversary21st June 2018
Dear Friends,
Itâ€™s hard to believe that a family business with 8 trucks and a hanger in Mascot would develop and grow into what it is today. I like to think that our 25 years of success can be attributed to a meticulous commitment to our core values: our commitment to our employees, and our service commitment to our customers.
This milestone provides us an opportunity to both reflect on our past and to look forward to our future. As we celebrate, I would personally like to acknowledge all of our customers, suppliers and employees, both past and present; for the integral involvement in the success of our business.
We sincerely thank you for being on the journey with us, and look forward to your continued support.
Joe Catania
Managing Director
