Sometimes, a nice straight-forward card is all that's needed, rather than one with bells, whistles, music, songs and jokes. Here is a selection of hand-picked classic designs which are more like a card you might buy in a shop and send in the post.

As well as Birthday Ecards, we have a host of other designs.
If you need something to cover the standard kind of expressions one might want to convey to people, such as congratulations and thinking of you to name but two, then look no further.
Here's a random selection of photo ecards:
Hi - sorry - I have decided not to remove the user accounts part of the site. Apologies for the confusion - the update from 27th October 2018 no longer applies.16-Dec-2018
I have decided to retain the facility to allow people to send ecards with a future send-date. This facility will still be available even after the user-accounts side of the site is removed at the start of 2019.
You will still be able to send ecards with a future send-date, and use the ecard history by email page to get a list of ecards you have sent and from there, either preview or delete them.
You might be forgiven for thinking that the jimpix site is a dead zone, with no update since December 2016. I've added 198 new photo ecards this evening. They're also available in gallery format. In October last year my family and I were fortunate enough to go on holiday to South Africa and Botswana for 10 days. I've finally sorted the photos out and put them on the site.03-Sep-2017
A new video ecard, Alive
We traveled three weeks through the northern Himalayas of India, from Himachal Pradesh to Kashmir. It was a journey from valleys to peaks up to 5000m. We experienced a massive amount of different cultures, three major religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, met incredible people, saw never seen before nature and walked right next to the wildest animals. It�s nearly impossible to recreate this experience and our feelings and to compress it to just 3 minutes. So I tried to express the spirit of our journey. What we felt more than anything else, is to be alive.
Beautiful!
No update since July! Sorry for the lack of updates.
I added a very powerful short film this evening called Love, Dad. You can read more about it on Short of the Week:
But this sums it up:
On the outskirts of Cairo, lies an entire city made out of, and built on top of discarded trash. It�s home to the Zabaleen - �people of the garbage� - who collect, and recycle everything from old food, plastic wrappers, tires, to aluminum cans. Each family has a specific role, from the smallest child to the oldest grandparent, sorting the waste and continuing the family business. 25 years ago, A woman named Maggie Groban, known as �Mama Maggie,� did something unexpected. She started a school right in the heart of Garbage City. A first for the Zabaleen. Suddenly, families had a hard choice to make. One that would surely cost them immediate profit loss by not putting the kids to work. However, a few brave parents took a risk - and put their kids in school.
