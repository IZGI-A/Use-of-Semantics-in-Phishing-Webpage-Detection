Welcome to the SUSI website where you can find information on making a student grant application. Before applying for your grant, we would encourage you to review the eligibility criteria by selecting your student type based on whether you are PLC, Undergraduate, Postgraduate or Studying Outside the State.
You can also use our Eligibility Reckoner where you can quickly and easily self-assess whether you may be eligible for a grant.
Links to the student grant legislation and a step-by-step guide to help with filling in an application can be found in our Resources page.
