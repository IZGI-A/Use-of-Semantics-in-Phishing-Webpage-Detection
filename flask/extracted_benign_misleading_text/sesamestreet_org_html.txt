About Sesame Workshop
Our Mission
Sesame Workshop is the nonprofit educational organization behind Sesame Street and so much more. Our mission is to help kids everywhere grow smarter, stronger, and kinder—and we’re at work in more than 150 countries, using the power of media and our beloved Muppets to meet children’s development needs with critical early education, social impact programs, and a large dose of fun!
