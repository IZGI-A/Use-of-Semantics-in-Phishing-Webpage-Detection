Absolutely amazing, smooth, my new favorite extension. Saves massive resources and incredible organization. The joke in the creative world centers around who has the most tabs open, this is really a great design!

This extension is totally awesome. I'm a user that likes to keep tabs open rather than bookmark them (which creates a lot of clutter for me) which I then always seem to forget to revisit. Toby allows me to keep visual track of my interests and in effect is my personal "to do list" when it comes to follow-up and research. Thank you. This is by far the most useful extension I have ever come across to date.

Out of all of the "new tab" extensions I've tried, Toby is the absolute best and most useful. Tab management is a HUGE help for freelance writers like me and I'm super happy to have found such a great one. Thanks, team Toby!
