StickyPiston believes in server aftercare and we manage all our servers from start to finish. No limitations, no “Fix it yourself” and definitely no extra $£€ addons. Our aftercare includes;
** Are you still reading this! *** Now get a custom server :)
* No really, there’s no addons here. No hidden terms
* Please look around at how other hosts charge for this!
We are the custom modpack specialists. No additional fees *, a simple upload and transfer system and ongoing aftercare. Everything a modpack creator needs!
With unlimited updates, mod-list changes, configuration fixes, crash assistance and monitoring for your server, you won’t find another host that can match our custom modpack expertise.
Use our click and play system to install and manage up to three Minecraft server instances. It only takes 20 ticks to swap between worlds, modpacks and MC versions.
Choose any Minecraft server in our library for a free 24 hour play session. Share the instant IP
with friends and when it ends, transfer to a fully featured hosting package to stay crafty.
