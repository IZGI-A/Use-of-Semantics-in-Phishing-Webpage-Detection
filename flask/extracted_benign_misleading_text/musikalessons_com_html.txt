People are busy these days, we get that. That's why you have the option of taking lessons in your home, online or at a nearby teacher's studio.
Instructors can opt to have a background check on file. You can request to only be connected with teachers that have a check. The choice is yours.
The instructors in our network create their own lesson plans based on what is best for you or your child.
You pay for lessons, thatâ€™s it. Choose from our pay as you go monthly billing or opt for a set of lessons.
We'll ask you a few questions so we can put you in touch with teachers in your area. You can choose to have lessons in your home, at a teacher's studio nearby, or online.
Book your trial lesson day and time directly with the teacher. If you wish to continue, simply let us know by contacting us.
Begin your lessons or try a different instructor. If you are not satisfied, you will not be charged and we can match you with a new teacher for another trial lesson.
Our son really enjoys his instructor, Nick. He is into death metal and plays guitar, bass and drums. He practices several hours a day and is now exploring baroque and classical music. We are very pleased with the teacher we found through Musika.

Wow! Belinda and My daughter have made phenomenal progress, and she is such a wonderful instructor. She's nearing completion of her 4th lesson book already. We knew she has talent, but it is testament to Belinda's talent as a teacher that she is doing so well.

We found a talented musician through the Musika website, who is also a comfortable and patient teacher. We've already noticed a steady progress in my daughter's understanding of the practice material, reading, and playing quality.

Select all the days/times the student would be available to start lessons. Selecting "3pm - 7pm" means the student can start as early as 3pm or start as late as 7pm. It is important that you select as many days and the widest window of start times for each day as possible. That will help us make a match with one of our teachers.Ok
Are you sure that's your only availability? The more availability you easier it will be to arrange a teacher for you.
