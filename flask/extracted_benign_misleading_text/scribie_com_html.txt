Highly Recommended By Our Customers
Service was faster than expected. Error rate was less than 1%. I am very impressed. I will call on you again. A great value at price. I have worked with news networks that use the expensive services out of New York. Your service is equal or better.
Ron Blome, Ron Blome Productions
The transcripts are very accurate. I like the pricing options based on turnaround time and the ability to track progress prior to completion. They have always met their deadlines.
Charles Senteio, University of Michigan School of Information
I selected the within 7 days option for receiving my transcript (which gave us a great 20% discount) yet I still received them in less than 24 hours. I thought that was pretty great. I also liked the editing feature that lets you listen to the audio while following along with the transcript to make any changes needed.
Erica Rich, Lifespan
I appreciate their ability to be flexible and provide transcripts earlier if needed OR later if we do not need them for awhile. They also adjust or provide pricing adjustments if not able to transcribe the file. Thank you for your competitive pricing and great service.
Sarah Iqbal, Advantis Research
I have been using Scribie since the days of Call Graph: I opened my account in July 2008! I have always been impressed by your commitment to keep doing better work, and somehow you do. Scribie has helped me do my job better, by giving me more time to be creative. Thank you for making it so easy!
Tim Wilson, CreativeCOW
We are very happy with the speed, the assurance that the transcripts are being reviewed by a supervisor and the ability to review exactly where content is indiscernible so that we can fill in the blanks with the "check and download" option. We are constantly requiring transcription services and are thrilled to be using Scribie.
Teri Bowers, Institute for Rapid Resolution Therapy
Customer service is excellent. The support team has communicated very promptly whenever I have had questions. Your staff graciously compiled individual transcriptions into a single document for me. I have already recommended Scribie to other members of an e-learning community. Thank you very much for offering high quality transcription at a very reasonable price.
Derek Frankhouser, Manhattan Prep
Scribie has always provided top notch service. Transcripts are always delivered on time - usually ahead of time, and your attention to detail is most impressive. We do a lot of interviews, sometimes 6 or 8 a day, and it is all too easy to incorrectly identify a recording. I am very grateful that, on more than one occasion, you have noticed and brought to my attention when this has happened.
Bonnie Wooding, Buyer Persona Institute
I have to say that I found dealing with Scribie to transcribe several oral history interviews and public radio documentaries a terrific experience. The entire process far exceeded my expectations. The work was done in a timely way (actually ahead of time each time). I was kept informed of each step of the process, which I like very much. The transcripts were surprisingly accurate and professional and the price was plenty modest. I have already recommended your services to several friends and businesses whom I think could use them. And I'll surely do that again when I need them.
