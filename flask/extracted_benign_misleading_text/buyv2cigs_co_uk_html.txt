E Cigarettes: Why Make the Switch to Vaping?
One of the most important issues to people across the globe is the state of their personal health. Yes, this is even ironically true for most, if not all, tobacco smokers. Though they understand the risks associated with tobacco smoking and the damage they are doing to their bodies, the fundamental health concerns are still there.
Fortunately, e cigarettes were introduced to the market several years ago. Though final conclusive research on vaping is yet to be released, we currently have a myriad of case studies showing the promising health benefits of ecigs compared to tobacco. In addition to world renowned doctors, government health bodies such as Public Health England have conducted their own tests on e cigarettes and the health effects connected with their usage.
In August 2015, PHE noted that, "In a nutshell, best estimates show e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful to your health than normal cigarettes, and when supported by a smoking cessation service, help most smokers to quit tobacco altogether."
But aside from being significantly less harmful to your health and helping smokers quit in a more successful manner than other smoking cessation devices, there are still numerous other benefits to e cigs over tobacco cigarettes. These benefits include, but are not limited to:
- No tar in e cigarettes
- Cheaper to vape than smoke tobacco cigarettes
- Range of e liquid flavours to choose from
- Enjoy e cigs in many areas where smoking is prohibited
- No staining of teeth
- No foul smells and odours
In addition to the above benefits, e cigs are far better for the environment. Combine all of this together, and it is no surprise that close to 3 million people in the UK alone have made the switch to e cigarettes.Though V2 Cigs sell vaping products to millions of happy customers across the globe, we still have some ways to go. With over 10 million tobacco smokers in the UK alone, we can help improve the health of millions of more lives. So if you haven't yet made the switch to vaping or you have family and friends trying to kick the tobacco habit, put your trust in us to help make it happen.
In the autumn of 2019 we are looking foward to launching the Ripstick and RipTide Vaping products to the UK. RipTide's Ripstick is the next generation vape pod system that utilizes Nictech, an enhanced nicotine technology.
