A blog hop is a linky list that is SHARED ON MULTIPLE BLOGS.
When several blogs put the same linky list code on their blog, the exact same
list appears on each blog.
Blog visitors can submit their entries on any blog that contains the list. The
entries will appear on each blog where the list resides.
Blog readers see the same list on each blog, and can "HOP" from blog to blog
seeing the same list of links to follow: BLOG HOP!
By designating your linky list as a BLOG HOP, a link will appear below
your linky list where your blog readers can get the blog hop code for your
linky.
If you want to do a 'PRIVATE' blog hop, then do NOT check the blog hop checkbox,
and simply share the code PRIVATELY with the other blog owners.
Brent Riggs & Linky Tools create the concept of
the "blog hop" as it is used on so many blogs today.
