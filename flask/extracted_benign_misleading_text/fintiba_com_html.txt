Really a Good service for students who are in a hurry to open a blocked account
When you arrive in Germany you are going to have to finish some papers to get your money but that is just how things are in Germany. I like how easy they try to make the process and I feel sometimes that they delay verifying some papers until they are able to take a look at everything. All in all, a great service and a trusty one and that's what you should care about If you are in a hurry.

I believe that Fintiba is the best solution for whom are planning to pursue their studies in Germany.
Fintiba provided me with the best service when I was preparing for my student visa from Turkey in terms of opening the bank account so quickly and issuing the bank statement in a short notice which I needed to attach with my visa application. Fintiba team was available all the time and quite supportive. You are doing a great job Fintiba and wish you all the best!
