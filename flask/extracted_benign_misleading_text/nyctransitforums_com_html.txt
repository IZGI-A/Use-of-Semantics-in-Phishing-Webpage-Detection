- Joel Up Front Today 7:03 AMI see modern announcers as nothing more than corporate mouthpieces
- paulrivera Today 7:30 AM@Cait Sith God help me when Smackdown moves to Fox next week and Joe Buck ends up making a cameo appearance...
- Cait Sith Today 11:42 AMHis voice will be just as monotonous as Smackdown has been.
- 4P3607 Today 11:25 PMYeerrrrr
- B35 via Church Today 11:40 PMFunny... I see athletic actors as corporate slaves.... Thanks, Donald Sterling.
- B35 via Church Today 11:42 PMLol, Jose Altuve.... Aint hear near as much d*ckriding on the guy this year, from Joe Buck or from anyone else...
- paulrivera 25 Sept 4:03 AMRemember when Chris Davis from the Orioles was supposed to be the second coming of Babe Ruth? Man, his stats just fell like a rock after that one great year he had...
- Cait Sith 25 Sept 5:40 AM@B35 via Church That's because Justin Verlander is getting most of the attention now lol
- LaGuardia Link N Tra 26 Sept 2:12 AMI stopped watching sports all together. Iâ€™d rather just watch it
- Cait Sith 26 Sept 3:33 AMYou should probably reread what you just said.
- NY1635 26 Sept 3:36 AMI think he means he's tired of watching the ESPN hypeman spin sports, and rather watch it somewhere else
- LaGuardia Link N Tra 26 Sept 9:20 AM@Cait Sith oh crap. I meant to say that Iâ€™d rather PLAY sports. I was half asleep when I wrote that.
- NBTA 27 Sept 12:04 AMWho's ready for basketball season? (if you guys watch it)
- B35 via Church 27 Sept 4:02 AMThe Mets.
- Joel Up Front 27 Sept 4:17 AMLet's list everything good about the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
- Joel Up Front 27 Sept 4:17 AM1)
- trainfan22 27 Sept 10:33 AM@NBTA I am. Nets should be a playoff team this year, Kyrie Irving hurt his jaw but I hope hes back by the time the season starts.
- trainfan22 27 Sept 10:34 AMLA NBA fans have it good with both the Lakers and Clippers which should be playoff teams this season, can't wait until both the Knicks and Nets are relevant at the same time. Always fun when the Jets, Giants, Yankees, Mets are good at the same time.
- Joel Up Front 27 Sept 11:44 AMwhen that happened with the Mets/Yanks world series in 2000, it didn't attract much attention outside of NY...
- B35 via Church 27 Sept 9:41 PMThe Mets' national following isn't at all significant & there's a nationwide hatred for anything affiliated with the Yankees..... To many, the Yankee franchise is the embodiment of corporate greed....
- B35 via Church 27 Sept 9:43 PMI'm of the ilk that believes that the Knicks & the Nets will never be concurrently relevant (in terms of winning anyway).....
- B35 via Church 27 Sept 9:48 PMGotta love how the narrative of both the Jets & the Giants flip-flopped over the course of 2 weeks.... Jets coming into this season were supposed to be this playoff team & the Giants coming in, were supposed to be amongst the bottomfeeders of the league.... Now this MF-er Jones makes one start & all of a sudden, people are drumming up these (worst case) scenarios with the other teams in the NFC east, that has them (the Giants) being playoff contenders....
- B35 via Church 27 Sept 9:51 PM...meanwhile, Darnold comes down with Mono & the 2nd string guy breaks his leg.... and some of the same people in sports media are playing situations out to where the Jets'll be 0-6 by time Darnold comes back... And how nobody makes the playoffs after such a putrid start... It's all you've been hearing lately on sports talk radio....
- B35 via Church 27 Sept 9:54 PMDoesn't help that Jamal Adams is acting like a big baby, quitting his weekly spot on WFAN because he can't handle the line of questioning being thrown at him.... Granted, Maggie Gray's voice makes me want to jump off a cliff, but there was nothing wrong with how she handled that last show w/ the guy..... These athletes today are too mentally weak
- LaGuardia Link N Tra 29 Sept 7:24 AMWho went to the parade of trains today?
- TheNewYorkElevated 30 Sept 11:36 PMI did and man it was one huge historical event without a doubt.
- LaGuardia Link N Tra 1 Oct 7:29 AM@TheNewYorkElevated you can say that again
- Cait Sith 1 Oct 12:12 PMDidn't bother.
- Far rockaway 2 Oct 2:52 AMI went. It was good. The way the nyc transit maintains those cars is just awesome. I especially like that aqua blue color on the r33 car.
- Far rockaway 2 Oct 2:53 AMThe BMT standards can haul power. They ran mad good.
- Joel Up Front 3 Oct 2:36 AMI'm living it up now but in another month I'll be watching the sun go down at 4:00 PM
- LaGuardia Link N Tra 3 Oct 4:04 AM@Joel Up Front wait. Next month!?!
- LaGuardia Link N Tra 3 Oct 4:04 AMWow, I didn't realize how close we are to ending this decade.
- LaGuardia Link N Tra 3 Oct 4:04 AM2020 here we go.
- Joel Up Front 5 Oct 4:47 AMmy god, I cannot take the new MTA site
- Joel Up Front 5 Oct 4:47 AMthe old one wasn't exactly the pinnacle of web design but it didn't feel bloated and it was simpler
- trainfan22 5 Oct 6:59 AMIf you don't have high speed data the new MTA site can't even load cause its so bloated, have to go to twitter to find out about service alerts
- trainfan22 5 Oct 7:01 AMOne thing I do like about the new MTA site is when you look up between two LIRR or MNR stations it shows all the stops each train makes between said stations. I like this cause as a railfan its easier to seek out certain runs..
- trainfan22 5 Oct 7:04 AMLike weekday reverse peak from Long Beach to Atlantic Terminal, West Hempstead to Atlantic Terminal, etc. The new site made me find out about about an Sat Afternoon Barclays special run from KO to BK... would have never known about it from the old site.
- NoHacksJustKhaks 5 Oct 8:26 AMI enjoy the transit websites of the MTR and TFL more than the MTA, they have a better layout and design in general.
- NY1635 5 Oct 5:22 PMThe MTA is using the redesign as a pretext to update their maps and make it less confusing
- B35 via Church 5 Oct 10:35 PMYou mean like NICE did when they got rid of so many lines on the Nassau county bus map to "update their map and make it less confusing"?? Don't be dense.
- Joel Up Front 6 Oct 2:00 AMI honestly wouldn't mind taking NICE if I was just going a few miles down the road. Doing what I had to do to get to college and back? The hell with that
- Joel Up Front 6 Oct 4:03 AMI'd use their Traintime app far more if it didn't update every time you blinked
- NY1635 6 Oct 10:42 PMJust saw the Joker Movie. It's confusing from a railfan perspective cause the dude commited murder on wall street, @ the Bronx, and somehow had time to get to Rock Center on the same R32 train
- NY1635 6 Oct 10:42 PMOn top of that, he can afford MNRR to visit Wayne Manor all on a wework contract
- trainfan22 7 Oct 1:19 AMI'm not to familiar with Batman universe, but don't those movies take place in a fictional city called Gotham?
- NY1635 7 Oct 1:23 AMGotham is the worst part of the Bronx mixed in with the Worst Part of Lower Manhattan
- Joel Up Front 7 Oct 6:12 AMThese superhero movies are all the same now... but those spoilers
- trainfan22 7 Oct 6:46 AMHaha, I was wondering if someone was gonna mention him spoiling part of the movie. Personally I didn't care cause I had no plans of seeing this movie
- Cait Sith 8 Oct 6:16 AMWell, I'm glad that someone mentioned spoilers because I was about to scroll up to see what I missed in the chatbox....now I'm not going to....ðŸ˜‘
- Cait Sith 8 Oct 6:16 AMGotham is a mix of two cities, New York & Chicago, but primarily New York.
- subwayfan1998 8 Oct 2:51 PMHello Guys, I've got permanetly suspended from Twitter thanks to these Right-Wing Cuntservatard trolls
- ToxxixxTimm19 9 Oct 12:59 AM@subwayfan1998 yikes.
- paulrivera 9 Oct 1:51 AMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfhnW6_l7w0 Let's decipher how Cuomo wants to speed up the subways, shall we?
- NY1635 9 Oct 2:21 AMHe wants to speed everything up
- NY1635 9 Oct 2:21 AMI'm more concerned with speeding MNRR up. Tired of doing the whole tour around Upstate just to get into Connecticut
- NY1635 9 Oct 2:23 AMI'm surprised to see Orion Vs still operating on the 13 to Tarrytown. Maybe NICe should get some and Gilligs for the Middle of the Island
- NY1635 9 Oct 2:24 AMI'd honestly put RTS Novabuses on the n22, and n24.
- trainfan22 9 Oct 3:05 AMWhere are you gonna get these Novabus RTS from? Very few of them exist these days
- trainfan22 9 Oct 3:08 AMThere's one transit agency still operating 35FT RTS in North Carolina...Those are probably the last ones left in regular revenue service
- subwayfan1998 9 Oct 3:15 AM@ToxxixxTimm19 I Know, Because these trolls who support that MF in the Office spreads inflammatory comments and calling for violence towards Liberals and People who held Left-Wing Views
- subwayfan1998 9 Oct 3:39 AMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZw-XL5TIIk watch this video how i exposed UTTP Users on Twitter Prior to my Permenant Suspension
- Joel Up Front 9 Oct 5:12 AMUsing buzzwords doesn't make you politically aware
- Joel Up Front 9 Oct 5:13 AM"Left! Right! Liberal! conservative! [party]-in-name-only!" All the same crap
- paulrivera 9 Oct 6:09 AM@NY1635 I know, right? GCT-New Haven is creeping closer to 2 and a half hours with every schedule change they do. That's more of CT's problem, but still...
- Joel Up Front 9 Oct 7:57 AMIf you predict anything "north and west of the city," it means it's not coming anywhere near the city. Useless forecasters
- B35 via Church 9 Oct 8:00 AMYou still goin on about the whetherman? I stopped putting faith in those fortunetellers ages ago....
- B35 via Church 9 Oct 8:02 AM93 degrees one day & in the next, 61 degrees.... Stupid shit.
- Joel Up Front 9 Oct 10:13 AMI can tolerate that. I can't tolerate the sun going down earlier
- B35 via Church 9 Oct 10:31 AMThe sun going down earlier around this time of year is normal, I prefer darker, cooler days anyway.... However, 30+ degree variance in temperature in consecutive days isn't.... The game is foul & the ref is dirty.
- LaGuardia Link N Tra 9 Oct 10:36 AMIs it me or do I find the Winter months more beautiful than summer months? Especially during the Sunset.
- B35 via Church 9 Oct 10:46 AMBy far, AFAIC
- BM5 via Woodhaven 9 Oct 11:22 AMI've always said that Winter has the best sunsets. I've grown to get used to darker days over time (and I can tolerate colder temperatures). The only good thing about the summer is that the days are long, but temperature wise, ugh.
- NY1635 10 Oct 6:46 AMI wish the n35 south of HTC had service that ended at 12am. Tired of having to wait for the n40/41 to go into service. The n40/41 is either interlined with the n6 or n4 depending on the overnight run
- NBTA 12 Oct 1:02 AMyoyo, back with the sports topic, how y'all liking the NBA Pre-Season?
- paulrivera 12 Oct 7:46 AMThat game in China was something...
- TheNewYorkElevated 14 Oct 12:41 AMYup. The odd vibes was due to the whole tweet about a General Manager tweeting support for the protests in Hong Kong, and how the NBA was basically de facto bowing to China's demands.
- NoHacksJustKhaks 14 Oct 1:28 AMmany american companies are bowing to the PRC, look at how Apple got rid of the ROC flag emoji in Hong Kong. It's all about not losing a large audience and revenue source in mainland China.
- NoHacksJustKhaks 14 Oct 1:29 AMin hong kong, it's basically war between both sides atm
- BM5 via Woodhaven 14 Oct 8:55 AMI wondered why "cowgirls" was trending on Twitter, and then it all made sense. LOL!
- BM5 via Woodhaven 14 Oct 8:59 AM.
- NBTA 14 Oct 9:44 AMLmao!
- B35 via Church 14 Oct 12:01 PMThe games have less to do with wins/losses anymore & more to do with storylines.... Although I didn't think they'd have the Jets win though...
- paulrivera 14 Oct 2:02 PMThe Yankee game tonight was quite the dramatic little game. Now itâ€™ll be an even series coming back to the Bronx.
- paulrivera 14 Oct 2:05 PMSpeaking of, is that playoff Lo-V trip still a thing?
- TheNewYorkElevated 14 Oct 11:06 PMYes, they still do run the Lo-Vs when the Yankees make some serious progress in the important games of the season (i.e. Opening Day, the run ups to the World Series, etc)
- Joel Up Front 17 Oct 1:25 AMthey're all going to game 7's, there's too much money (tickets/TV deals/contracts) for them not to
- NY1635 17 Oct 2:35 AMThey're going game 7 because Lebron screwed up in China
- Cait Sith 17 Oct 8:35 AM^Huh?
- B35 via Church 17 Oct 9:23 PM^ LeBron got traded, fam... You didn't see him in his Yankee fitted?
- B35 via Church 17 Oct 9:25 PMHonestly though, who knows wtf this dude NY1635 be on sometimes..... Sad part is, he's not trolling either.
- Harlem Crosstown 18 Oct 12:17 AMWent to the Bronx zoo over the weekend and watched some toucans fight with their beaks, they do it to play and I found it really interesting
- Joel Up Front 18 Oct 2:27 AM"because lebron screwd up in china" TRANSLATION: We want chinese money
- Joel Up Front 18 Oct 2:28 AMbecause God knows good ol' American boys don't care about overpaid athletes mumbling into mics, there's more money overseas
- B35 via Church 18 Oct 3:23 AMThese greedy ass owners of these sports franchises have been clamoring for more games in the regular seasons and/or post seasons of these sports.... They can script these outcomes to their heart's content for all I care - but it's most definitely not some new phenomenon "because LeBron screwed up in China", which is what's being implicated...
- Sherley fabre 21 Oct 2:02 AMAnyone knows how training is like for the mabstoa bus operator
- Sherley fabre 21 Oct 2:05 AMDid someone ever goes to the 7 days training with a commercial b permit and made it to the training and the road test I wanna some inside info about what is the training like and what they ask you to do on the pre- trip during the road test
- Cait Sith 21 Oct 6:03 AM@Sherley fabre Post in the employment section, you'll get answers much quicker. https://www.nyctransitforums....forum/19-transit-employment/
- NY1635 21 Oct 8:42 AMHow long has that NICE timetable at 179th Street Subway been there? I noticed it yesterday as I got off the
