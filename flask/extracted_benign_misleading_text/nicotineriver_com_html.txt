The Vape Kitchen was born from the single idea that hardworking, honest people can make high-quality juice at an affordable price. They are made by the diligent, for the hardworking. No flashy marketing. No hidden corner-cutting. Just the purest, vaping experience on the market at a price everyone can appreciate.
We can accomplish this a few different ways. First, we diligently work to develop and craft several flavor profiles. We go through rigorous processes with a group of people who care deeply about our products. Our flavors are then tested and re-tested. Only the best of our flavor profiles are selected and sent to a group of individuals for multiple tastings and final selections. The most important detail of this process is that we have secured partnerships with elected producers of the highest quality ingredients and operations available. We also use, what we believe to be, the best nicotine provided. Once our product is thoroughly mixed, each batch is tested for purity and taste before being sent in for bottling. Once this lengthy process is complete, and all standards have been met, we finally release our authentic, finished products to the market.
There are several ways used to keep our costs low and affordable. One is due to the time and energy we have spent developing our in-house distribution and shipping systems. These systems improve efficiency at all points of the distribution and shipping chain. This, coupled with a ‘no-fat’ policy, produces cost savings that are then passed on directly to the consumer. This grants us the luxury of providing our customers with a premium juice at a fair price, including free shipping on all orders $9.99 or more. We choose to be defined by the idea that we will stay humble and work harder than the competition. We are The Vape Kitchen. We are made in the USA, and we are proud of it.
Our products are manufactured to the highest safety standards — no exceptions.
From unqiue flavors, to the smoothest, most satisfying chemical compounds, we know nicotine.
We’re a leader in our field, but our team consists of real enthusiasts with bold ideas.
At River Supply Co., everything we do is for the benefit of the vaping and e-cigarette community, and the hobbyists that know and love our products. Our research and development team is constantly striving to achieve new heights through innovation, and the highest standards of quality and safety.
