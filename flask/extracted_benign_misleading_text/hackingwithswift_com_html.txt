Swift gives us map(), compactMap() and flatMap() methods, but although they might sound similar they do very different things. So, in this article we’ll look at map() vs compactMap() vs flatMap() to help you understand what each one does and when it’s useful.
iOS 13 introduced new type-safe initializers for Core Image filters that allow us to use them much more easily – and without having to hope that our code works at runtime. Previously much of Core Image was stringly typed, meaning that we would create filters using strings, which in turn meant that Swift couldn't be sure that when we asked for a value to be set that it would actually exist. iOS 13 replaces that with a much better implementation, and you'll never want to go back to the old way.
Apple just updated its Swift Playgrounds iPad app with support for Swift 5.1, dark mode, and SwiftUI, which means it’s now possible to try building SwiftUI apps and components entirely on your iPad.
