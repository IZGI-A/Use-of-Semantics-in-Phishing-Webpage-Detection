"Unifying Spirit and Mind"
Wherever you start from, just curious or Quantum, we awaken your potential by knowing both your physical self and spiritual self.
If you have experienced any of these statements, your awareness of ‘something’ is already activated.
All these occurrences and many more are the hidden senses within you that you may choose to activate, to understand, and to control. These signals or messages are demonstrating a reality that is not physical; utilising the energy of spirit brings a life of joy, ease and an understanding of who you are.

Di Merrick and Nicky Rawle have collaborated their spiritual knowledge and understanding to present a comprehensive journey for you to reawaken to your spiritual self. They have a deep understanding of the spirit realms and the connection between the spirit mind and human mind.
Diane was unaware that she closed her spiritual abilities as a child only to reawaken after the birth of her own child. She is a qualified teacher but followed her passion to become an international animal communicator and healer. Nicky has been a natural intuitive from a very young age; in 2012 Di became her mentor and together they now present their unique approach to teaching you about your spiritual self.
Di and Nicky are passionate about helping people understand and connect to the spiritual essence of who they are. Whether this is dormant or active we support you to enhance your connection. Everyone has a spiritual essence but they do not necessarily activate it within themselves. You are not just your physical body, or your spiritual body, you are so much more. We are dedicated to supporting you to connect to your spiritual self and the limitless potential that the world of spirit provides.
