Never ran a gameserver before? Our control panel is super easy to use, guiding you through every step. Of course, if you're more advanced you'll still have full control of the server.
Add credits to your account and we'll then draw from them as you use your server. You'll only be paying for the time you use the server. Read more about our innovative pricing system.
We invest 10% of our profits into the growth of E-Sports. We're also gamers, and we live, breathe and eat E-sports. Read more about this.
Renting a server is easy, simply select what game you want and your server will start automatically. Stop the server with 1-click when you're done.
At a certain point, your server won't cost any further money for the rest of the month. Enjoy playing the rest of the month for free. Read more.
Our networks have DDoS protection, so you don't have to worry about angry opponents ruining your experience. Ride lag-free to victory!
Let's face it. Renting a gameserver has never been flexible enough. You need to use it for a certain amount of time, but you're stuck with options like "3 hours", "1 week" or "monthly". This is why we re-thought pricing entirely and came up with our "Pay Only What You Use"-system.
