The hall reopened from 17 August 2020 and we welcomed back hirers, both longstanding and some new to the hall. We are closed again, complying with government restrictions, but hoping to re-open again on 2 December 2020.
The Committee has carefully applied all relevant law and Government guidance in re-opening. We have arranged the additional cleaning required, installed new signage and necessary equipment and made other practical changes to reduce the risk of Coronavirus being brought into the Hall or transmitted there. We have had to modify our Hiring Contract which now has some additional conditions to make sure those who now use the Hall stay safe.
