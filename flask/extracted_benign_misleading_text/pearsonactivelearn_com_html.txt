Make time to teach
Spend more time delivering inspirational lessons, building confidence in your learners and creating individual success with time saving resources.
Personalise
Fuel learners’ curiosity by customising lessons with front-of-class resources and develop their learning skills through online homework with a range of hints and learning aids.
Measure progress
Help learners develop and progress. Identify their needs both in class and independently while allowing you full view of exactly how the group and individual have performed.
“Brilliant in terms of time saving for teachers.”
