|Verizon blocks emails
|05 Jul, 2015
|It appears that Verizon does not know how to deal with spam properly so they just blocked all IP addresses they don''t know. This way all Myibidder emails (including support) to Verizon customers are being blocked. There were several attempts to contact Verizon support, but all of them were ignored and silently dropped.
It's highly recommended to switch to something better (like gmail.com or similar) if you expect to receive your response from support tickets.
