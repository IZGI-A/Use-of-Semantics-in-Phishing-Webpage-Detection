The Ren'Ai Archive is a collection of original English-language visual novels and ren'ai games. We aim to provide an archive of all complete games of this type that we can distribute for free. This site allows anyone to add games they've created or discovered.
You can use the navigation bar at the left to search for a game and to find all games of a given type. Or, if you are feeling lucky, check these randomly selected games below.
If you have a game that's appropriate for this website, you can Add a New Game by filling out a simple form. We'll check it out within a few days, and add your contribution to the site. If you need help, please post in this forum thread.
