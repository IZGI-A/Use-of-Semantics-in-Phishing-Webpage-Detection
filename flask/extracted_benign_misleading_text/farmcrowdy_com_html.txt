Farmcrowdy is an innovation that is out of this world. It is unique because of the coordination of its activities and regular update to sponsors. It took away the burden of supervision and monitoring from me and I would certainly recommend Farmcrowdy to others. My only regret is not investing more as a foundation member/sponsor.

The idea behind Farmcrowdy is quite good. It has the potential to create jobs for lots of people. It is very easy to do business with them because everything takes place online. I would recommend them to others.

A very competent and efficient business that does business with integrity. Their transparency and ease of communication made it easy for me to do business with them. I would recommend them to others because I have been treated well. Word of advice: Don't rest on your laurels.
