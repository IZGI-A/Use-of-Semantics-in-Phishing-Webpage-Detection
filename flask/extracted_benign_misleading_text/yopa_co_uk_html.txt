When it comes to the smooth sale of your home, we’re here every step of the way.
Everything traditional estate agents do, we do too. We’re also here on evenings and at weekends, when you need us most.
You’ll only pay one fee, and it’s fixed from the beginning. There are no surprises, and we never add commission.
For extra peace of mind, choose to pay our fair fixed fee only when your home is sold. Or, if you’d prefer, simply pay upfront.
Your dedicated local estate agent and their team of property experts will be with you at every step until your home is sold.
Catch up with viewing requests, offers, and feedback whenever you want using our simple online tool, YopaHub.
Our partners can help with mortgages and conveyancing, and every homeowner gets a free utilities switching service.
Your local Yopa agent is an experienced professional who lives in your area.
