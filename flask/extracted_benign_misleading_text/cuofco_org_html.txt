We’re not a bank. We’re not a bureaucracy. And we’re not-for-profit. Which simply means there are more reasons to love everything we are: member-owned, friendly, fair and dependable. At Credit Union of Colorado, you have a stake in our financial institution. The money we make on interest and fees goes right back into the credit union in the form of better interest rates, lower fees, and dividends for you. And our Credit Union of Colorado Foundation gives back to the communities we serve, awarding grants to help build a better today and tomorrow for Colorado. As we’re fond of saying, we’re here to help.
