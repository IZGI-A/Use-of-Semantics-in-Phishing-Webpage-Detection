Ejari is a system that is governed by RERA to make registration of rental /
lease agreements easy and accessible to Owners and Real Estate Management
Companies of various categories.

the initial lease agreement. Renewals, cancellations, transfers and
terminations can all be logged.

At a different level, full implementation of Ejari registration will enable
the authorities to construct a full and accurate picture of Dubai's rental
market which will play a crucial role in its planning for the future of the
sector and its ability to influence such factors as the supply side of the
market and ultimately the level of prices.

|
Ejari will ensure rental agreements are fair and transparent to the parties
involved and that their terms and conditions are given full weight. The
launch of Ejari shall bring the Dubai's rental sector to be one of the best
regulated rental market in the world and best practice in the norm across
Dubai's rental sector.
