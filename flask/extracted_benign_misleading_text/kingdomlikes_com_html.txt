How we work
Kingdomlikes is a network operating through the exchange of social actions (like for like), that is, you will announce your Facebook page, Instagram Photo, YouTube video, Twitter profile, etc ... and other users of KingdomLikes will give you like if they are interested in your content. If you want to announce your sites in Kingdomlikes, you need "POINTS" and these points will get giving likes and watching the content of other users, in this way ensures that all interactions are from real people, the same users KingdomLikes.
