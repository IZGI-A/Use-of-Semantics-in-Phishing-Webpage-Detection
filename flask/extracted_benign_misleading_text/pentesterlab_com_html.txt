“The exercises and course content provided by PentesterLab has allowed for me to continually excel in bug bounties and penetration testing in my career by ensuring that I am well aware of the techniques, methods and attack vectors that any good pentester should know. As PentesterLab Pro does not require you to set up VMs, more time has been spent on learning and applying rather than simply setting up labs or vulnerable VMs. The return received from subscribing to PentesterLab has been far greater than the little investment that I have put in. ”

“I consider PentesterLab to be a great resource for learning about web application security and ways how it can be subverted. Even though the exercises usually don’t take much time to complete they can teach a lot. I can’t but recommend it, especially to any aspiring junior penetration testers out there.”

“PentesterLab is an awesome resource to get hands-on, especially for newbies in web penetration testing or pentesting in general. It gives insights to possible web security flaws, their behavior and approaches that can be taken to exploit them. More of, it does help in developing a hacker-like mindset. Kudos & Thanks to PentesterLab!!”
