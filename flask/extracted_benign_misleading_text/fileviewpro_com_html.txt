The Problem
my-file.ext
You're trying to open a file you've received through an email attachment or a file on your hard drive, but your computer won't let you do it. You get an annoying pop-up window that says, "Windows can't open this file".
The reason why you can't open your file is because you don't have the EXACT program to open that EXACT file extension. What could be more frustrating?
