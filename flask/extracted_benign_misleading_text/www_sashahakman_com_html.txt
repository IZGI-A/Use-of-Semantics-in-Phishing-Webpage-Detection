Exercise & reproduction: is there a connection?
One of the most common things women suffering from infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and/or obesity are counseled by their physician is to do, is "eat healthier" and "lose weight". Many patients with whom I discuss lifestyle modification, insist that they have tried everything with no avail.
In a 45 minute consultation where the primary focus of the office visit is to discuss your diagnosis & treatment, there is little time remaining to provide in depth teaching to help achieve the lifestyle recommendations we are prescribing. My goal, is to help provide evidence based information learned from scientific journals to help you achieve important lifestyle goals!
