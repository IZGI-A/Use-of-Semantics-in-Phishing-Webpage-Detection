Benefits
Since we have a supply of coins/tokens, we also have bidding and asking prices for ourselves, which is based on the starting prices of the coins/tokens for the day, and we earn from that bid-ask spread. To simplify, you can think of us as “retailers” of assets, in which we have bought wholesale and distribute it to traders more conveniently in exchange for a little profit. Furthermore, as a coin/token gains popularity and more traders, more market makers come into play which results to a competition. We will compete to have a smaller bid-ask spread, giving traders more options to maximize their investments.
