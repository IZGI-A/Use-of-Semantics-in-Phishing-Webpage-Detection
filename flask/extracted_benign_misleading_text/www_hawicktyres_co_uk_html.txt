What our customers think
“I needed a new tyre following an MOT advisory and Raymond provided outstanding service by supplying a good tyre at a great price. He even prepared for my appointment by researching my MOT history and therefore knew exactly which tyre needed changing. Whilst the work was being done I was invited to sit in a warm, comfortable lounge with free hot drinks. Brilliant and I'll definitely be back for my annual MOT and car service.”
“Quick, efficient and friendly service for puncture and tyre check. We’ll be back. ”
“Above & Beyond ! Had a 2 hour drive down from Glasgow and was not happy with front brakes during the journey. Upon arrival near Hawick I telephoned Craig Motors who could not fit me in immediately but called back within the hour with immediate availability. They took the vehicle in, advised me of the problem and dealt with it within hours. I was delighted and would like to thank all staff and especially Raymond for brilliant customer service and effort. Thank you. ”
