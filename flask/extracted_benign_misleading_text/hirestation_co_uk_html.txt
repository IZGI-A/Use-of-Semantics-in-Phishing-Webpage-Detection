Order & Collect
Our order and collect service is available on all orders placed online, on the phone or in the local branch. Please note local branch prices can differ from the website and you may not get the same special offers and prices as advertised on this site.
Our professional staff will show you how to use the machine in the branch, but please also note the hirer should collect so he / she knows how to use the equipment. If you are collecting from us on behalf of someone else, please be aware we cannot be held responsible for any operating errors or faults.
When collecting from a local Brandon Hire Station branch please make sure you take two forms of ID and one must be photographic. Brandon Hire Station may also require a deposit when you collect, so please ensure you take a credit card. Deposits will of course be returned when you return the item back to the branch.
You can return the equipment you hire to ANY Brandon Hire Station branch.
