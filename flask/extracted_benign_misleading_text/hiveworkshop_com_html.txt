[Updated 22-10-2019)
It's been almost a year since we've seen or heard anything from Warcraft 3 Reforged - until now.
Recently, people have discovered that Blizzard uploaded a BETA of Warcraft 3 Reforged to the Battle.net launcher, but it's encrypted.
However, some guys at wowhead.com and users named Stiven_SRB and Songzeee was able to datamine UI, loadingscreens, portraits & unit models!
Take a look!
Got some more information? Post below please.

We are excited to announce the first ever The Hive Workshop pro-tournament for Warcraft 3.
The Hive Workshop Cup is a competitive 1v1 tournament where members of our, and the greater Warcraft 3, community will compete for a prize of €555.
Today, we're excited to have the opportunity, thanks to the sponsorship of @Nightmare2077, to run a competitive 1v1 Warcraft 3 tournament for our community, and Warcraft 3 as a whole. We are also working with Back2Warcraft to organize and cast this event.
The Hive Workshop has been a dedicated community creating custom experiences in Warcraft 3 for many years. And it's important for us to have the tournament to reflect this. This is why we'll be using community maps for the map pool.
A contest for our community tournament!
We're hosting a melee map contest where the top 4 maps get a spot in the contest. You're allowed to submit 1 of your maps - new or old - for this contest. Either create a new map, polish an existing one, or submit an approved map you've previously made.
Tournament schedule:
- The tournament map pool contest will be conducted from now until October 6th, 2019. The top 4 maps will be selected for the map pool.
- The Hive Tournament will have 2 open qualifiers from October 12-14, 2019. The top competitors of this group will move on.
- Following this, the Hive qualifiers will take place October 15th, 2019. Exclusive to members of the Hive community (prior to September 20th, 2019), the top 2 competitors of this group will move on.
- The Playoffs and Finals will take place October 18th and 19th, 2019. The top players of all 3 qualifiers will compete for the grand prize of €555.
Details on registration and format will be announced soon.

Hey all,
Today I was contacted by a good samaritan on Discord who had found that a list of usernames and passwords for The Hive Workshop had been leaked from the hack back in 2016. I did not reset people's passwords back then, so I have done it now.
If you cannot login:
Use the 'Forgot your password?' feature.
If you don't have access to the email account or don't get an email:
Use this 'Contact Us' link.
Do not create a new account.
I have deleted the passwords for around 60,000 accounts on the site because they were leaked. I am sorry if this is an inconvenience to you.
If you used your password and email from 2016 on any other site, I highly recommend you change it. Go to this site to get a quick overview of the status of whether any of your emails or passwords are in the hands of someone else.
I also recommend using LastPass for storing randomized passwords for each site instead of re-using the same old ones.

We are extremely excited to bring forth the commencement of the Warcraft III Anniversary Week event!
July 3 marks our favorite game’s 17th birthday since its original release in 2002. Since then, the entire WC3 community has created an unfathomable amount of content and memories that no one could have ever foreseen coming. This week, we will explore the legacy that thousands of players and creators alike have contributed to. Prepare for a blast from the past, inject a heavy dose of mana-nostalgia, and gaze towards the future with the culmination of everything that is Warcraft III: Reforged.
Delay/Update
FEATURE LINKS:
Article: Reforged Recap: The Future of Warcraft Part II (OUT NOW)
Media: WC3 History: Warcraft III Community Map HD (OUT TUESDAY)
Article/Media: WC3 History: The Story of Warcraft III (OUT WEDNESDAY)
Other: Yet to be revealed, TBA
This is presented by Hive, the W3U Discord, and the r/Warcraft3 subreddits, but we cannot thank all the other communities enough for how much they've contributed to the game over the years. Just yesterday B2W live-casted WC3 Esports history.
