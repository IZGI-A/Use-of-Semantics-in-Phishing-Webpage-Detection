Customer success is absolutely top priority for us at sli.do. Especially in the event industry, a few seconds can make a big difference. We analyzed most of the solutions out there and LiveAgent is by far the best. It combines excellent Live chat capabilities, ticketing and powerful automation that allow us to provide exceptional support to our customers. And all of it comes with a great price, highly recommended!
We are using LiveAgent mostly for its chat feature. We like it because it is easy to use and offers great functionality, such as useful reporting features and process automation. Furthermore it is easy to integrate into our own user system through the API that is being offered. Finally it is really fast, easy and fun to learn and their customer support is always helpful. Thanks for the good service!
We've switched from another affiliate software to PAP. Post Affiliate Pro is a much more advanced tool and it offers a lot more features than our previous tool. We're very happy with our decision to switch to PAP. The customer support of Quality Unit is by far the best support that I have received so far. I highly recommend PAP to anyone who wants a reliable affiliate software and exceptional customer service!
