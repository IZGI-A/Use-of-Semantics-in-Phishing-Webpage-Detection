If outdated scheduling processes are still in place at your business because “that’s how it’s always been”, your business is going to get left in the dust. Ditch a slow, painful scheduling process for an appointment scheduling software tailored for small businesses
Scheduling may sound like an easy task, but all of your spreadsheets and sticky notes beg to differ. Paper based scheduling systems make it difficult to stay in sync and know which clients are coming in when. Nothing’s more embarrassing for a business than a client showing up for an appointment that you don’t have on your books.
When your customers visit your website, they get all excited about the services your business offers. They can’t wait to schedule...except they have to, because your business is open from 9 - 5 and they are looking at your website while in their pajamas watching Netflix at 10:30pm. Let customers book at any time and any place with 24/7 booking.
Do you ever feel guilty for all the missed calls you get from clients? We feel your pain. Missed calls are the pits. Plus, having to call people back only to get into the “what time works for you” conversation will take a chunk of time out of even the most productive person’s day.
Today, less than 33% of appointments are booked online mostly because businesses don’t offer the option. That number, however, will more than double by 2019, with clients of small service-based businesses becoming more & more disgruntled when they can’t schedule online. Are you willing to run potential clients off by not offering the convenience they expect?
