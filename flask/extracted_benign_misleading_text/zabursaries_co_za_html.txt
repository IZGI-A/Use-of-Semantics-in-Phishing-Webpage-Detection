List of ALL Bursaries in South Africa 2019 – 2020
Are you looking to further your studies but lack the funding to do so? Do you have a strong academic history, which you have maintained throughout the year? Whether you’re in your last year of school and thinking about joining University or College next year, or if you’re a current student who cannot afford to continue paying for your studies – if you have a good academic record, but your household income does not permit you to study, you may qualify to apply for a bursary or scholarship award.
Most organisations that offer bursaries, require that their bursars complete a work/ training programme on completion of their studies, in lieu of the bursary awarded – this is beneficial for both parties, as the student has guaranteed employment after completion of their studies and the chance to gain invaluable work experience.
SA Bursaries is the biggest bursary website in South Africa, with the most comprehensive list of the bursaries in South Africa. Simply scroll down to your faculty of study, select a bursary which best suits your needs and follow the instructions provided on how to apply. It should be noted that students can apply for as many bursaries as they qualify for.
