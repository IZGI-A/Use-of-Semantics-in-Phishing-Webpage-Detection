Welcome to Lincoln County High School, home of the Panthers!
Each school year represents a new opportunity for personal, social and academic growth. The goal of the faculty and administration of
Lincoln County High School is to provide an education that encourages and develops social and emotional growth, critical thought, analytical problem solving, leadership and citizenship. We urge our students to undertake challenges, become involved in school and community activities, and to make their personal mark on our school. At Lincoln County High School we believe that education is a life-long process and we aim to instill a love of learning within our student body. In order to prepare students to meet the demands of a rapidly changing world, course offerings need to be rigorous, challenging and relevant. The new school year promises to bring about continued positive changes at Lincoln County High School and I invite you to get involved! Let's make it a great year! Bring on the Panthers!!!
Sincerely,
Tab Mathis
