Love for the Club
“I'm in LOVE 😍 - remembering to take my birth control daily is already such a hassle and so is refilling my prescription and driving to my local pharmacy to pick it up. Now, with The Pill Club, I don’t have to worry about my next pack getting to me on time. I LOVE the convenience and adore the extra gifts 🎁 which range from tampons to cute stickers to chocolate 🙌🏼. I definitely encourage all my ladies out there to check this out to make your life easier ✌🏼. ”
“Sooo I think I just found my ⭐️ favorite subscription of all ⭐️ from @thepillclub 😍 You can have your birth control delivered right to your door! FREE! Filled by a licensed pharmacist! They accept most insurances with $0 copay & free shipping. ”
