Seeking Direction - On How to Buy Rental Property and becoming a LandladyI want to purchase my first rental property in the very near future. I'm already a homeowner. I need to diversify my portfolio so I thought having a steam of monthly income would be a good route. I have spectacular credit so I don't see an issue with getting approval. I was thinking of purchasing a condo and renting it to a family member but that would just be a single rental so I'm not sure how much I would make from that.
I've also thought about a 2 to 4 flat.
What steps should I take to understand being a landlady, purchasing rental property and building wealth from my rental property?

Anyone ever order their Thanksgiving meal from a restaurant?If so, what were your experiences? This year I don't want a "traditional" Thanksgiving meal and I don't want to cook. I'd like to order out and that can mean anything from pizza to Chinese food or a BBQ meal from a spot we like.

How could I ever forgive my Sister and Nephew?I got into a heated argument with my sister and she and my 10 year old nephew (whom I've always loved and took care of) both yelled me out of the home screaming every homophobic and degrading work you could think of. The argument stemmed from me telling my nephew to get off of the video game after midnight on a school night. He cried to his mom and in return she told me to "HAVE YOUR OWN KIDS! Dont tell my kid what to do." This is after she came home around 1AM after a night out and he ran crying to her about the game. She passifies him with this game and its her way to get out of the house or to get him out of her hairs for hours. He plays fortnite all day! Can barely wake up for school the next morning. He literally RUNS her.
They called me ******, Gay, You like Dick..etc Everything you could think of.
Now my sister has issues. I've always known this. My family has always known this. But I cant believe she allowed my nephew to do/say those things...

Wasted 4 years of college, now what?I have nothing to show for it. No networking/volunteering experiences. I actually started taking classes in my current major (public policy) in Spring 2018. Needless to say, my gpa is a 2.049. I honestly wished I would have taken a year off, but I never knew this option existed. I would have prefer to have went to community college instead, but of course I was pushed to go to university immediately, which I regret. Now I have 11,000 in student loans.
I have to make an appointment to meet my advisor. I took this semester off. He suggested I can do some courses at a community college and then finish them at the university. But is there any point of going back to college? My gpa is so low, I'll probably never get it to a 3.0. Thing is, I don't feel passionate about my major. At first I like the idea of doing something related to social justice, but I could also just volunteer in me free time. I don't want to waste more time and money.
Is the beauty industry an option? What careers...

4-year-old niece only wears extensions--how to approach her momMy niece is a very sweet, extremely cute 4-year-old little girl. Her mom (my sister-in-law) started using braiding extensions when she started preschool as a 3-year-old. It is clear that she doesn't like wearing her own hair anymore and only feels cute when she wears long braids. When she wears extension braids, she is outgoing, gives hugs, loves meeting new kids and playing. When she wears her own hair (which is probably neck-length, natural 4C hair), she is shy, withdrawn and only wants to play alone, doesn't like going out of the house, pretends to be sick so she won't have to go to class, etc. One weekend, her mother was sick so she couldn't do her hair. My niece had to go to school with her natural hair and was so upset that she made herself vomit to come home.
Clearly this is a problem. My sister-in-law keeps appeasing her by letting her wear extensions. Not only that, but her hairline is starting to break off and recede because of the continuous high-tension hairstyles....
