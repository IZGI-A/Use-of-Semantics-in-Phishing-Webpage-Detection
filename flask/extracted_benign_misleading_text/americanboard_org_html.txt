I teach 11-year-olds every day and I adore them. It is the most rewarding thing if I can hear that I’m making a difference in their lives or if I’ve made something click for themShelli, 6th Grade English Teacher, South Carolina
It has been amazing to lead the classroom it’s really where I think I’m meant to be because I’m making a huge impact on kid’s lives. The growth that I can see in the kids, they come in scared and shy and by the end they’re ready for life, know their alphabet, how to write and read. They’re confident and engaged learners.Katie, Kindergarten Teacher, Idaho
The best part of being a teacher is definitely the kids. I feel like seeing their excitement, even kids that are resistant, seeing them learn something for the first time makes it worth it. I look forward to being in the classroom no matter what’s going on and I didn’t have that in my other profession.Jennie, 7th Grade ELA Teacher, South Carolina
