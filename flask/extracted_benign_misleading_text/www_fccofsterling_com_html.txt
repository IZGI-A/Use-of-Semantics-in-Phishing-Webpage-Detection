A Message from FCC of Sterling...
Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic we will be having Drive-In Worship in the back parking lot of the church! This will be conducted via an FM Transmitter. Therefore, you will be able to remain in your vehicle and listen to worship. The worship team will be set up outside or inside Coleta Chapel (depending on weather), so you will be able to see and hear us.
Here are a few things to remember as we begin Drive-In Worship:
-
Radio: tune in to the preselected radio station on your FM radio so you hear the worship.
-
Excited to see everyone? We are too! However, in order for us to make this drive-in worship work, we ask that everyone remain INSIDE their vehicle for the ENTIRE service. You will see a few people out of their vehicles, and that is only because theyâ€™ve been asked to by the Worship Team.
-
Are bathrooms open? Yes and no. As much as possible, we would like everyone to stay in their cars. However, we understand not everyone can hold it for very long. Please use the restroom before you leave the house. But if you must go, please use the Lysol wipes provided to wipe down any surfaces you touch.
-
What about communion? There are two options, either you grab communion on your way in, or you bring your own.
-
Songs and Bulletins? Bulletins will be handed out along with communion, and also attached to the e-echoes if you would like to avoid the table. Song lyrics will be printed on the back-side of the bulletin.
-
Giving? We will set up offering baskets on the way in and out for you to drop your offering in. In addition, you can stop by the office during the week, or mail it in if you please.
-
I really liked Facebook Live. You are in luck! We will continue Facebook Live throughout this time, and well in to the future!
*We will continue to update everyone on services and our plans to re-enter our building. The re-opening team is meeting regularly and keeping a close watch on the situation*
