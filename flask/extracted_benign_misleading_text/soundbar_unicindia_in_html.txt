A sound bar is a simple, space-saving option for bringing a wide range of Dolby Atmos content to your living room. Here are some things to look for when choosing a model that's right for you.
Sound Bar Buyer's Guide
Budget
Sound bars are available in a wide range of prices to fit your needs. Factors that can affect price include special features like online access, number of speakers (inside or outside the sound bar itself), and connection types.
Room Size
Sound bars with upward-firing speakers reflect sound above and behind you for a heightened, three-dimensional soundstage. Front-firing speakers virtualize height for sound that seems to flow all around you.
Connections
Ensure that your sound bar has the correct connections for your TV and other components, including HDMI®, which is required for Dolby Atmos® sound.
Soundscape
In numbers such as 5.1.2 and 7.1.2, the first digit represents the number of simulated traditional surround speakers; the second, a subwoofer; and the third, upward-firing speakers supporting Dolby Atmos.
