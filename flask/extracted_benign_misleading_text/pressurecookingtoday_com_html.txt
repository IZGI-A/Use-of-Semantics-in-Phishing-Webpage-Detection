The Instant Pot Duo Evo Plus is the latest and greatest in the Instant Pot line of pressure cookers. Theyâ€™ve taken everything you love about the classic Instant Pot Duo, made some design improvements, and added several new features that I think youâ€™ll love!
The moment we heard about the Instant Pot Duo Evo Plus, Barbara and I knew we had to get our hands on it. The product design team took feedback from actual users and redesigned the Duo based around the usersâ€™ needs!
Since Mom was out of town, I bought one and brought it home to test it out. And I liked it so much that I didnâ€™t want to share it when she got back in town!
