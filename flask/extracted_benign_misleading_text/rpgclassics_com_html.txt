Only four years late. The Knights of the Old Republic Shrine is now officially published; and so it is a pleasure to welcome Blennus to the staff. Congratulations.

We're still not dead! This is a notice that we'll be changing hosts in the upcoming days: You should expect some downtime. It's also possible that some webpages will break, if so, please let us know on the forums!

We're not quite dead! If you've paid careful attention you might've noticed there's been some activity on the Wiki. Not nearly enough of course, so now we are calling on volunteers to help us wikify a few recent games:
So if you're a Final Fantasy Fan, and you'd like to help us create the best online resource for Final Fantasy XIII, register on the Agora and then use that username and password to login on the Wiki! We need content in all areas -- Walkthroughs, strategies, secrets, characters, equipment, and more. We welcome any contributions!

Finally! That took a lot more time than expected. Let's blame Merlin. There is still a lot left to recode so expect pages that look out of place and like they were written in the late 1990's. Don't be alarmed if pages suddenly change during the next several months. Should you feel nostalgic you can still access the old frontpage here. If you find something that is broken, please let us know.
