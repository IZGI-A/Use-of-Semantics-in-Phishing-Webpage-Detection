Before we became a DynEd partner, we used overvaluated other e-learning courseware for our learning programs. I can say with conviction that no other courseware that we have used comes anywhere close to providing the results that DynEd provides. In particular, the brain-based learning methodologies, around which Mr Lance Knowles has developed the DynEd courseware, make DynEd’s programs a clear leader in language learning effectiveness. Since we began using DynEd courseware in our programs, many of our students have shown a clear acceleration in their learning curve. Based on our experiences, I strongly recommend the DynEd e-learning courseware.
Based on my experience as a teacher and teacher trainer, I believe the RHR learning theory is very useful for teachers… My only regret is that I didn’t know about this theory many years ago. I recommend it highly as a real advantage in language teaching.

Our faculty appreciates the way DynEd off-loads practice activities to the computer environment to free up face time for higher quality communicative activities.
DynEd has given students in the IEP at TCU a chance to get ahead in English learning not only in our lab, but also from their own homes.
