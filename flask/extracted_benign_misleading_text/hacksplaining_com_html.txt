My company uses their own custom login code. 15 minutes into the
SQL injection lesson I realized we needed to have a meeting about
security practices!
Iâ€™ve always thought that learning how to hack was one of the best ways
to learn how to defend yourself from attacks. You should send all your
web developers, and even your IT staff, to check out Hacksplaining.
Extremely impressed. This website is very well done, and we will be
using Hacksplaining as a training tool for newer developers.
Netsparker, the developers of dead-accurate web application security scanners have sponsored the Hacksplaining project to help raise web application security awareness which allow more developers to learn about writing secure code.
