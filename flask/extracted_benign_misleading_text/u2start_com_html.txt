If you bought a Red Zone or VIP ticket for U2's 360 Tour, for many shows afterwards you were sent a digital photo of the show you attended. We browsed through our photo archive and selected the 12 most amazing shots from that collection to celebrate this years 10th anniversary of the tour. And at the end we include a link to the entire collection. Maybe your city is there as well.
