At The Academic Institute of Excellence (AIE) we understand that each person prefers different learning styles and techniques. This is influenced by many factors including, circumstances, location, field of study and learning preference. It is for this reason that we have developed our myWay learning methodology, a unique and modern approach to blended learning that encompasses multiple delivery methods, involving our three main channels.
Reach your full potential through our myWay Instructor-led or Mentorship based classes combined with interactive lessons, practical assignments and in-field experience, combined with our blended platform to make up a full day or selective days within a week.
Designed for the working professional, our part time programmes provides you with the flexibility and benefit of our myWay Blended Learning with at home exercises/assignments and mentored or in-class lectures at a manageable schedule and pace.
We have re-defined online learning. Our myWay Online Learning ensures that the student is supported by technology and people throughout his academic journey. We focus on a blended learning approach, combining online Virtual Classrooms, at home exercises, activities and project-based assignments bundled with fully developed video lectures, all managed by our student learning platform.

I am writing this letter to strongly recommend The Draughting Academy for your future study course. I myself enrolled with the The Draughting Academy back in 2013 at the Sandton campus and have to say that I was not disappointed at all about the course they offered. Since I graduated from The Draughting Academy at the end of 2013 I started working in February 2014 as a Structural Draughtsman in Randburg/Northcliff. For someone like myself who had no background in working with AutoCAD I was quite impressed in how fast I learned to use the program. I am not disappointed at all and would definitely enrol for the Revit short course when I have time.JJ de Jager, Structural Draughtsman, Alumni Student
Ek wil graag die geleentheid gebruik om almal baie dankie te se vir al die moeite en werk wat in ons gradering in gegaan het. Almal met wie ek die aand gesels het was vreeslik beindruk met hoe dinge gereel was. Die hele kurses was n wonderlike ondervinding en dit was n voorreg om julle almal te leer ken.Henk Schoeman, Alumni Student
I have been a Draughtsman for 8+ years and thought that I knew all there is to know about Draughting. All I can say is, “I was wrong”. The Draughting Academy made me a better, more accurate and more sufficient Draughtsman. Thank you for helping me to hone myself into a proficient and more confident Draughtsman. By far the best thing that could ever happen to my Draughting carrier!Gert Strydom, CAD Operator, Alumni Student
I am a mother dripping with pride, thanks to your efforts.Cynthia Hobbs, Proud Parent
We do appreciate all you do - and thank you for putting my mom's mind at ease. She phoned me at work and told me she had a chat to you and that you were really kind to her. I appreciate your kindness and thank you in talking to my mom. Take care and keep being a caring person - it sets you above the norm that do not care.
Claudia, Happy Student
Thank You. You people are the best.
I am very gratefull for all your help.Chante Meyer, Proud Student
Just a compliment to those involved in developing the content for Digital Marketing and Introduction to Design. The study guides are very well written and the information is clear and current. I think all the students are getting excellent value from this course.Antoinnette, Proud Student
Thank You for your kind and professional service, you give me confidence in coming to study with you guys and can't wait to register.
I got the info I asked for and thanks once again.Alten-Jay Machobane, Proud Student

This makes it really worth to say that my child is studying at AIE.

To Everyone at The Draughting Academy,
Thank you for making my experience at the Academy so memorable! As someone that had no draughting experience prior to attending the academy, I felt very comfortable and truly mentored throughout the course. I learnt a tremendous amount thanks to all the lecturers' patience and guidance, and am now in a position I could never have dreamed of. Thank You!
Thank you Clarisse for your dedication and addresing the matter in a very professional way. I am still commited to putting my son through your college and depending on the treatment we get from our first born at your school, we will send the other upcoming two kids to study there. Looking forward to a bright future and good relationships.Parkso Mokoena, Proud Parent
I would like to mention that if it was not for AIE, I would not have been able to open my own Business, one that I dream about for 15 years. This means more to me than you will ever understand. AIe is the absolute best and this is where leaders are born. SA needs AIE branches everywhere. If my company could design and build them, why not? We need to get more AIE branches up, no jokes. Your system is working and I see improvements after the merge with the Draughting academy.
Ps. Ignore negative student comments, as you know, this happens everywhere. I am telling you as a student, that I am very pleased and do advise to everyone in SA. I pray for you and do wish you all the best. Love you loads!! Honestly.Niël Slabbert, Proud Student
I do not know whwere to begin. Thank you so much, I am overwhelmed with happiness. I really appreciate your effort into pushing my things. I am looking forward to the others.Nadine, Proud Student
Ek en my man wil julle net graag inlig en bedank vir alles wat julle vir Strijger gedoen het. Die engineering company waar hy werk in Faerie Glen het hom ‘n permanente pakket aangebied uit 7 junior draughtsman uit. Hy geniet sy werk vreeslik baie (meestal Constructional Steel) en hy is goed daarin te danke aan die opleiding wat hy van julle af ontvang het. Hy het die voorreg om meestal op Tekla te werk en die blootstelling is van onskatbare waarde. Dit was rerig die beste belegging wat ons vir ons seun kon maak om hom na die CAD Academy toe te stuur.Louis & Celana, Proud Parents, Alumni Student
I would like to bring to your attention about the excellent service that I have received from Nicole. Her care and concern towards her client was excellent. She responds in such a great manner. It was such a pleasure to actually work with someone like her on trying to get my studies going. She is a star sales person in all aspects. She went the extra mile in helping me out whenever I needed her help & tried her best to keep me happy in whatever she brought forward.Kinola Tasmeen Naicker, Happy Customer
Dear Clarisa, Thank you for all your help this past the year. You have been a great help throughout this year.

Distance learning is no joke and you guys have made it a positive experience.Thank you and enjoy your holiday.Kegan Boddy, Distance Learning Student
