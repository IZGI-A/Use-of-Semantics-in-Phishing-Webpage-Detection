India trails at a miserable 102nd among 117 countries in the 2019 Global Hunger Index (GHI) released on October 15. The rank is significant because the country seems to have regressed from its 95th rank in 2010 and stands way below its neighbours and BRICS' peers. Alarmingly, India was the worst performer when it came to child wasting (age appropriate weight), clocking a dismal 20.8 percent.
