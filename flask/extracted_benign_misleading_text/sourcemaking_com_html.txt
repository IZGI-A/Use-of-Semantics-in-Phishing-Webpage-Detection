Design Patterns & Refactoring
Hello, world!
I'm SourceMaking. I will tell you a lot of stories about good software architecture and teach you how to create it with design patterns. I will guide you through anti-patterns, common pitfalls and mistakes that people make when they plan, create, and manage software projects. In the end, I will teach you how to smell a bad code and improve it with refactoring.
We can start from the very beginning or you can pick a topic of interest below.
Design Patterns
Patterns are higher-order designs, which occur repeatedly in object-oriented design. They have been formalized, and are generally considered a good development practice.
Antipatterns
Antipatterns describe common mistakes, errors, and people issues that can cause a software project to fail.
Refactoring
Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.
