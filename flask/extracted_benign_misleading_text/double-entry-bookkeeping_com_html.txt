What is Bookkeeping?
When you set out to start a business as an entrepreneur you need to be in control of your finances and be able to track the performance of the business. The only way to achieve this is to have good accounting information and be able to understand what the information is telling you.
Bookkeeping is distinct from accounting which is usually undertaken by more senior staff. The purpose of the book-keeping process is to record financial transactions. The output from the bookkeeping process then becomes the input for the accounting process, which is the language of business used to interpret and analyse the information.
A Bit of History on the Double Entry Accounting System
Double entry bookkeeping is a system of bookkeeping which records each transaction twice. The system was first developed in the 13th century and used by Italian merchants. In 1494 Luca Pacioli a monk and mathematician was the first to publish a treatise (Summa de arithmetica) which included details of double entry bookkeeping. Pacioli recommended the Venetian method which included three books of account, the memorandum, the journal, and the ledger. The treatise was widely available and accessible and formed the basis of double entry bookkeeping practiced today.
The first entry records what comes into the business (a debit) and the second entry what goes out of the business (a credit). Every Debit must have a corresponding equal and opposite Credit.
