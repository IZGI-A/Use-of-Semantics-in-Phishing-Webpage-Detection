VPN is a technology used to protect your online traffic from snooping. Imagine a secure tunnel that hides your data from the eyes of your Internet provider, Wi-Fi neighbors and hackers. Pages you visit, images you download are encrypted by VPN tunnel and decrypted only on your device.
VPN is widely used for security purposes by businesses, corporations, governments and the military.

You will get the best speed and ping by connecting to the nearest VPN servers. A good practice (balance between speed and security) is to choose a server in the country next to your country, but not in the country where you are.
At this moment we offer servers in 30+ locations. We listen to your requests and keep on adding new locations every month.Check Locations
