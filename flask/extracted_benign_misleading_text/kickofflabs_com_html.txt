Customers say nice things!
We were pleased to find such a powerful viral tool for non-technical people like me. During our 8-week campaign, we captured more than 10,000 leads! There was an incredible response and sales went faster than we expected. Even if people didnâ€™t purchase, a lot of them posted about it and were generally excited.
Over 5 years, we slowly built our e-mail list to have about 25,000 leads. In a matter of one week, we doubled it through the assistance of Kickoff labs. It changed the game for our business.
Our launch got us 35,000 leads in 2 weeks with a 56.9% conversion rate! To add, 86.6% of leads were coming from KickoffLabs social referral mechanism. That means for every $1 spent we got roughly $1.86 worth of return out of that!
