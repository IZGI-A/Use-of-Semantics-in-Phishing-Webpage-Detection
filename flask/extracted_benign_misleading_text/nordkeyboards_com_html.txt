We are happy to present a brand new Nord Live Session featuring Brett Williams - a series of exclusive performances from US keyboardist Brett Williams (Marcus Miller, Snarky Puppy, Robert Glasper).
The opening episode is a funky piece named "Tonin'" where Brett is jamming out on some Wurly and B3 sounds backed by Morgan Ã…gren and Gustaf Hielm. The Brett Williams session was recorded live at RMV Studios in Stockholm, September 4th 2019 and the remaining episodes will be published in the coming months.
We are proud to present the Michael Bereal Signature Sound Bank for Nord Stage 3 - 25 unique patches created by legendary gospel keyboardist/producer Michael Bereal.
The sound bank is based on the Nord Stage 3 factory sounds and includes Michael's custom Acoustic and Electric Pianos, Layers, Synth Leads, Synth Brass, Strings and much more. A unique patch collection from one of the finest musicians in gospel music!
