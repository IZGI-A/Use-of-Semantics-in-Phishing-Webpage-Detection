Have you jumped on the air fryer bandwagon yet? I got one awhile ago and I use it all the time, and in ways I never expected! It’s great for heating up leftovers, like veggie burgers, potato wedges and I use it to cook my kid’s favorite vegan “chicken” nuggets instead of the microwave. And I love Air Fryer Tofu!
Next to my beloved Vitamix, the Air Fryer is turning into one of my favorite kitchen appliances! In fact, it sits on my countertop all the time because I use it so often, but it is small enough you could easily store it in a pantry.
