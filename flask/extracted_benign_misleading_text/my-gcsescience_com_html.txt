Success Stories
I wanted to thank your team for all the help I had for my Science GCSEs! For OCR Gateway A Combined Science I managed to get a 9-8! Thank you very much! August 2019
I got a 9 for Biology, an 8 for Chemistry and an 8 for Physics. Thank you My GCSE Science! I especially liked the message from your team before the first Biology exam which put GCSEs in perspective as not the most important thing in the world. August 2019
Thank you so much for your help. I missed out on a year of school and was predicted fails. I worked very hard using your resources as a form of independent learning and I went from a grade U in Year 10 to a 7-7 in my GCSE results today. Thank you. August 2019
I got an 8 in both Physics and Biology and a 7 in Chemistry. I was predicted 5s and came out as the most improved student in my school year. Thank you so much. August 2019
Thank you My GCSE Science. I got a 9-9 in my Combined Science results today and all the credit goes to your videos. Thank you so much! August 2019
A few months ago, I got a 3 in my science mocks. Today I achieved a 7-6 in my GCSE results! I could not have done it without My GCSE Science. August 2019
I cannot thank you enough. I went from scraping 5s in mocks last year to coming out with a 9-9 in Combined Science. Thank you! From someone who used to hate science, I will actually really miss it and grew to love it in its own way. August 2019
I just wanted to say thank you so much because today I got 9s in all three sciences and that wouldnâ€™t have happened without My GCSE Science (as soppy as that sounds). Especially Physics, I practically taught myself the course using the tests and videos and itâ€™s such a relief to know it all paid off so thank you once again! August 2019
It wasnâ€™t my results day today, but last year I got an 8 in Chemistry and Physics and a 9 in Biology solely because of your videos! I recommended it to my sister who isnâ€™t the biggest fan of the sciences and she passed all her science exams today too! I just wanted to thank you because if it wasnâ€™t for the confidence your videos gave me in Year 10 and 11, I wouldnâ€™t be pursuing medicine today! August 2019
I would like to thank My GCSE Science for being my saviour during my GCSEs. Thanks to your incredible videos and practice questions which were built perfectly around my exam boardâ€™s spec, I actually began to enjoy learning science during revision season, and not just feel obligated to. After receiving 9s in Chemistry and Biology, and an 8 in Physics, I am an example that even people who arenâ€™t naturally inclined to science can achieve great results with a little push.

I got 9s in all three sciences. I canâ€™t thank My GCSE Science enough. Your website and videos are amazing and without it Iâ€™m certain my grades would not have been the same. Thank you again. August 2019
Thereâ€™s been 2 years since I came to London to study, I came from Brazil with high expectations though my English wasnâ€™t very good. In Year 11 I discovered My GCSE Science. I used it until the tests finished and on the results day I was shocked by my results, with a fairly poor vocabulary I was able to get three 9s in Triple Science!! My GCSE Science has helped me to achieve my goals here in London and Iâ€™d recommend it to anyone who really want to get the best grades in GCSE Science, fabulous! August 2019
Thank you so much for providing such an amazing service. I got a 9-9 in my Combined Science, thanks to you. The videos were concise and informative, covering all the important parts of the specification. I felt completely prepared going into my exams and donâ€™t think I could have achieved as well as I did if it wasnâ€™t for this amazing website! I definitely recommend it for anyone that struggles to revise from a textbook as it engages you so much better. My GCSE Science truly helped me and I really hope that other students will be able to see the benefits too. Many thanks for everything. August 2019
Just wanted to say a massive thank you to the team at My GCSE Science. Iâ€™d always had a lack of confidence in science and struggled with how to revise properly. The site helped by covering every necessary aspect of the course as well as the motivational emails I received to keep me going. I genuinely felt like I was learning a different subject because of how easy to understand it was. I ended up with an 8-7 which was two grades up from my mocks. Thank you! August 2019
Your resources certainly helped my son achieve excellent grades in his GCSE science with a grade 9 in Biology and 8s in both his Chemistry and Physics. All other GCSE grades were 7 or below. The website gave him something to focus on rather than just reading text books. He also found the answer sheets very useful helping him to understand what the examiner would be looking for. Thanks for such a fantastic website. August 2019
I got all 9s and it was because of you guys. Thanks so much for your help. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š August 2019
