Flight ticket cost depends on several factors. First, the airline determines how much an airline ticket costs. This price differs by booking class. If you are looking to book a flight months in advance, ticket prices are generally lower. In the week before the flight departs, the prices of airline tickets for this flight will go down or just up, depending on the purpose of the airline and market demand. Other factors affecting airline prices include changes in fuel costs, airport tax and maintenance costs.
The name you have to fill in on your ticket must be the same as the name in your passport. That means: the first name in the passport and the last name. You do not have to enter your middle name. Pay attention to the name you write down when you are making your booking as changing a name later can cost a pretty penny! If your name is not correct on your e-ticket, we recommend that you report this to us as quickly as possible to minimise costs.
