We are very proud to say that we are the first and only Kawaii/KPOP shop to offer FREE Returns & Exchanges within 90 days of you receiving your order.
If you are not 100% happy with your order items or have any issues, just let us know and we will take care of it immediately.
This is how confident we are that you'll love shopping with us :)
All of our items are in Asian size which is smaller than US and European sizes.
We suggest that you order 1 to 2 sizes up - meaning if you usually wear a Medium, then Large or X-Large on our shop would fit you best ðŸ˜Š
If you have any questions or doubts, please let us know via Live Chat or Email and we'll do our best to make sure you receive the perfect sizes.
Our shoes are true to size, however, so please select your regular size if you're ordering shoes.
