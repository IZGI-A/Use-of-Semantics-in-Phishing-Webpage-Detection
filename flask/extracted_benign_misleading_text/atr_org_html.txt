5 Reasons Why Congress Should Pass USMCA
Posted by Samantha Capriotti on Tuesday, October 22nd, 2019, 9:00 AM PERMALINK
The United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) is a commonsense update to the 25-year-old NAFTA, will benefit American workers and businesses, and is widely popular among stakeholders in all three nations.
The agreement was finalized almost a year ago on November 30, 2018, yet Democrats continue to sit on their hands and have so far refused to put the agreement to a vote. This is despite Mexico already ratifying the agreement and Canada waiting for the U.S. Congress to act.
Rather than focusing on investigations and impeachment, Speaker Pelosi should bring the USMCA up for a vote.
Here are five reasons why Congress should pass the USMCA:
1. The USMCA will grow the economy
The trade agreement will increase wages, increase GDP by $68.2 billion, and create 176,000 jobs, according to the International Trade Commission’s report. It will also increase U.S. exports to Canada by $19 billion, and to Mexico by $14 billion.
These positive economic effects are identical to a 4% cut to the corporate income tax, as estimated by the Tax Foundation.
The Trump administration has already achieved economic successes through international and domestic policies. Thanks to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and more broadly, deregulatory efforts, wages are increasing 3.4 percent annually, poverty has declined 11.8 percent, and unemployment is at a 50-year low. Since the 2016 election, the Trump administration has created 4 million jobs and the median household income is at the highest level in U.S. history.
President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed a trade deal last month that reduced or eliminated most tariffs between the U.S. and Japan. In addition, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have achieved a Phase 1 trade agreement, which doubles China’s annual purchase of U.S. agriculture, improves intellectual property rights, and halts the planned 30 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.
The economy is moving in the right direction and the USMCA will further these successes by promoting trade with the U.S.’s largest trading partners.
2. There is broad support for USMCA
USMCA has broad support from Mexico, Canada, and U.S. stakeholders:
- President Donald Trump has called it the “largest, most significant, modern, and balanced trade agreement in history,”
- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a member of the centre-left Liberal Party of Canada, said it is “essential for businesses, families, jobs, entrepreneurs, and hardworking people in every corner of our country.”
- Mexico ratified the agreement almost unanimously with a 114-4 Senate vote. Mexico even passed a labor law in April that strengthens independent unions to address concerns raised by U.S. Democrats – a key step for U.S. ratification.
- Mexican President Manuel López Obrador, a member of the left-wing National Regeneration Movement Party said, “We think it suits us, that it is beneficial for more foreign investment,” adding that the new trade accord would help create more well-paying jobs in Mexico.
- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Thomas Donohue said, “If we came up with a good strong vote on that (USMCA), it would give us a great step forward,” adding his belief that Congress had “enough votes to do it right now.”
- The Washington Post said in an editorial that passing USMCA will “help stabilize the global economic outlook” and predicted if Pelosi would bring the agreement to the floor, it would pass both houses of Congress.
-
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) labeled the agreement, “unambiguously a win for America. It would create new jobs, expand export markets, strengthen protections for workers, and generate billions of dollars in new prosperity,” in a co-authored Wall Street Journal op-ed.
-
3. USMCA helps farmers, manufacturers, American workers and business
-
USMCA aids small and medium-sized enterprises, grants broader market access for all three countries, and benefits agricultural producers and manufacturers.
The agreement establishes the first small and medium-sized enterprises chapter in a U.S. Trade Agreement, which will increase transparency, accountability, and investment opportunities. International trade supports nearly 39 million jobs (1/5 of U.S. jobs), 12 million of which rely on Canada and Mexico, according to a Business Roundtable study. These numbers have doubled since NAFTA was signed.
This number will only increase with ratification of USMCA.
The increased market opportunities for Americans will also increase agriculture exports by more than $314 million. Through USMCA negotiations, Canada agreed to open market access to American farmers who wish to sell dairy, poultry, and eggs in Canada. In return, Canada will have access to American dairy and peanut products. A combination of poor weather conditions and the trade war with China has damaged the agricultural industry. The industry would benefit from stabilization of international markets, especially the U.S.’s two biggest trading partners that buy close to 2/3 of U.S. agricultural exports.
Already, the Trump Administration has created over 400,000 manufacturing jobs since the 2016 election, and manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest rate in over 30 years. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) released a supportive statement in which they say, “By securing the relationship with our North American allies, we are also better positioned to demonstrate a strong and united front against China’s unfair trade practices and end the harm they inflict on manufacturers in America.”
4. USMCA modernizes and updates a 25-year-old agreement
When the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was agreed to in 1994, the world was a dramatically different place. For one, the internet was in its infancy. Additionally, trade within North America was greatly hindered by high tariffs and investment barriers.
Billions of dollars are traded over the internet daily, yet NAFTA does not contain any relevant provisions. USMCA establishes numerous provisions on e-commerce, cross-border data flows, encryption and IP protection that are needed in today’s digital economy.
Before NAFTA, Mexico placed an average of 250 percent more tariffs on U.S. exports than the U.S. did on Mexican imports. Ratifying NAFTA eliminated tariffs on more than one-half of Mexico's exports to the U.S. and more than one-third of U.S. exports to Mexico. Facilitating free trade benefits all three states’ economies, but NAFTA does not address current trade problems.
USMCA will maintain and improve the border free trade that NAFTA began, while also establishing provisions necessary for 21st century trade.
The fact is, the global economy has changed. U.S. trade policies need to reflect that.
5. USMCA is crucial for swing states
Not only is the USMCA good for the economy and popular amongst a wide array of stakeholders, it is also a political winner.
31 of the districts Trump won in 2016 now have Democrats in the House, meaning reaching these constituents is important both for the future of the House and for the 2020 presidential election.
Looking towards the upcoming election, swing states are largely invested in international trade. In 2018, the fourteen swing states alone were responsible for 150.7 billion dollars in exports to Canada and Mexico. This includes Michigan, Florida, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, all 2012 Obama victories turned Trump victories in 2016.
For example, Michigan traded 36.1 billion worth of exports to Canada and Mexico in 2018. More than 117,400 Michigan jobs rely on this trade. In Ohio, more than 102,700 jobs rely on this trade and its 2018 Canada and Mexico exports totaled 27.9 billion. Pennsylvania traded 15 billion worth of exports, and 42,900 jobs in the state rely on trade with Mexico and Canada.
More than 2 million American manufacturing jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico. A win for these hardworking Americans could be the moving factor in 2020.

Clean Slate Promises Less Crime, More Jobs & Stronger Communities for Michigan
Posted by Doug Kellogg on Monday, October 21st, 2019, 3:26 PM PERMALINK
For people who have paid their penalties, and served their time in the criminal justice system, rejoining society can be a major challenge. The stigma of a conviction, even for nonviolent and misdemeanor offenders, can follow them as they try to build a new life.
They should have a chance to earn trust again, rather than being relegated to second class citizenship and punished far beyond what was intended. It’s not just the right thing to do, but smart policy that reduces recidivism, and strengthens families and communities. Making it easier to expunge certain crimes offers that opportunity.
A study from University of Michigan law school researchers found people’s wages went up by 20 percent on average one year after expunging their record, and that former offenders who have expunged their records very rarely break the law.
Michigan is currently considering a number of commonsense “Clean Slate” criminal justice reform bills that would expand expungement, and make the process automatic in some cases for people who have not reoffended – HB 4980, HB 4981, HB 4982, HB 4983.
While Michigan has expungement, it does not allow for records to be automatically expunged, usually known as “Clean Slate”. The state allows a person with a felony offense and no more than two misdemeanor offenses to petition to expunge the felony offense. Someone with two misdemeanor offenses and no felony offenses can expunge the misdemeanor offenses.
HB 4980 would mean an eligible offense is automatically expunged. A variety of crimes from sexual assault and violent crimes, to serious misdemeanors (like breaking and entering) would not be eligible. It requires that ten years have passed since the date of any sentence has been completed, and restitution has been paid. A person could not have more than two felonies or four misdemeanors automatically set aside.
Ten years is a significant amount of time. Justice Department figures show that re-arrest for former nonviolent offenders is very rare five or more years after release.
HB 4981 would make it possible to expunge some traffic offenses, but not serious ones like drunk driving, or if injury is caused, or if someone causes an accident while driving without a license. Currently, no traffic-related crimes can even be expunged in Michigan, which is onerous. The waiting period to apply for expungement would be reduced from five to four years following completion of any sentence.
HB 4982 would simply allow for the expungement of any misdemeanor marijuana-related offenses that are no longer a crime following the passage of Proposal 1 last year – a state voter initiative that legalized adult-use marijuana.
HB 4983 reduces the waiting period to petition to expunge a misdemeanor offense from five to three years. The waiting period for a felony offense would remain at five years.
People who have proven they have learned from their crimes should have the chance to leave that past behind, build new lives, and become full, contributing members of their communities. The opportunity to clear one’s record is an important incentive for people to avoid committing another crime later. That’s why these bills are so important as the end of this year’s session nears in Michigan.

Warren Dodges the Middle Class Tax Question Again
Posted by Adam Sabes on Monday, October 21st, 2019, 12:24 PM PERMALINK
Elizabeth Warren dodged the middle class tax question again after a town hall in Norfolk, Virginia on Friday.
Reporter: “Sen. Warren, I’m from Canada and we have some experience with medicare in our country. Your critics say that you are not telling the truth about what it would cost, the high cost, and that taxing the top 1 percent won’t pay for it. What do you say?”
Warren: “I say that I have made my principles on this clear. And that is wealthy people and big corporations will see their costs go up. And that hard working middle class families are going to see their costs go down.”
This is the 24th time that Warren has dodged the middle class tax question. During last week’s Democratic debate, Warren dodged the question six times.
Warren is avoiding the reality that middle-class Americans would have to pay more in taxes -- as Bernie Sanders notes is necessary -- to fund “Medicare for All.”
"Yeah, [we'd have to] raise taxes on the middle class," Sanders told a CNN reporter after the July debate.
Last week, ATR released a compilation video of the 17 times that Warren has dodged the question.
Warren repeatedly dodged the question in September during an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. An exasperated Colbert tried to offer advice about the "taxes that perhaps you're not mentioning."
In July, Warren got into a heated exchange with MSNBC's Chris Matthews while refusing to answer Matthews' question on middle class tax hikes. She also dodged the question during the CNN and ABC debates.
In POLITICO Jeff Greenfield noted that Warren could be holding back an admission that Medicare for All will lead to higher taxes for the middle-class because she is worried about losing voters.
Greenfield wrote:
This leaves an obvious question that will follow her through the campaign: “Bernie Sanders is frank enough to acknowledge the obvious, and then explain it. Why won’t you?” The answer may be as simple as: If you say you will raise middle class taxes, an unmeasurable but likely significant number of voters simply will not bother to wait for the rest of your explanation.
As the Washington Post reported, Kenneth Thorpe, chairman of the health policy department at Emory University directly said that the plan will hit the middle class.
“There’s no question it hits the middle class,” he said.
As ATR noted earlier, Medicare for All would require anywhere from $32 trillion and $36 trillion in higher taxes over the course of the next decade.

24 States Have Seen Record Low Unemployment Under Trump
Posted by Alex Hendrie on Monday, October 21st, 2019, 11:30 AM PERMALINK
24 states have seen record low rates of unemployment since Donald Trump became President, according to data released last Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The full list of states with record low unemployment rates under Trump includes Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
Many of these states have seen unemployment rates of 3 percent or lower under President Trump including Wisconsin (2.8 percent), Maine (2.9 percent), Iowa (2.4 percent), and Colorado (2.6 percent).
This low state unemployment should not be surprising – nationwide, the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in September, a 50 year low.
Since President Trump took office, over 6.4 million jobs have been created and the unemployment rate for Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans, and adult women has hit historic lows.
In August, there was over 7 million job openings and over 5.8 million people started a new job.
In addition, the ratio of unemployed persons to job openings is just 0.9 as of August 2019, according to recent Labor Department Job Openings and Labor Turnover Data.
Wages are also growing.
Real median household income has grown by $4,144, or 6.8 percent since the start of the Trump presidency, according to data published in the Wall Street Journal.
This is the highest real median household income ever and dwarfs wage growth under Barack Obama’s presidency which was around $1,000 as noted by Stephen Moore.
Clearly, the economy is strong for American workers and businesses. However, the Trump administration is not resting on its laurels and continues to push policies that build on this success. For instance:
- President Trump recently negotiated a new, U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. This agreement will lower barriers to trade and reduce tariffs, increase U.S. exports to Japan, grow the agricultural sector, and promote jobs.
- The administration is making progress on a phase one of a trade agreement with China. The agreement is expected to include a deal for China to buy U.S. agricultural products and a suspension of planned tariffs.
- The administration continues to push Congress to take up the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA). The USMCA would raise U.S. real GDP by $68.2 billion and create 176,000 American jobs, according to the International Trade Commission. The agreement will increase U.S exports to Canada by $19.1 billion and increase U.S. exports to Mexico by $14.2 billion.

Pelosi Drug Plan Could Impose 95% Tax on Cures for Cancer, Hep-C, MS and More
Posted by Alex Hendrie on Monday, October 21st, 2019, 10:00 AM PERMALINK
The House Democrat drug pricing plan championed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) could impose a 95 percent tax on hundreds of life-saving and life-preserving drugs including cures for cancer, hepatitis C, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis.
The legislation (HR 3 - the Lower Drug Costs Now Act) imposes a retroactive, 95 percent excise tax on up to 250 drugs. This tax is imposed on the sales of a drug if the manufacturer does not agree to government-imposed prices. The tax starts at a 65 percent rate, increasing by 10 percent every quarter a manufacturer is out of “compliance.”
Under the Pelosi drug plan, 250 medicines including 125 of the top Medicare Part D drugs (by total spending) are eligible to be selected by the HHS Secretary, meaning they could face the 95 percent tax.
Based on research by Americans for Affordable Prescription Drugs, the 95 percent tax could hit the following Part D treatments:
- Leukemia: 5 drugs to treat leukemia (Imbruvica, Imatinib Meslyate, Gleevac, Sprycel, Tasigna)
- Cancer: 6 drugs to treat other forms of cancer including breast cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, and kidney cancer (Ibrance, Imbruvica, Zytiga, Xtandi, Afinitor, Tarceva)
- MS: 7 drugs to treat multiple sclerosis (Copaxone, Tecfidera, Avonex, H.P. Acthar, Ofev, Gilenya, Avonex Pen)
- Schizophrenia: 2 drugs to treat Schizophrenia (Invega Sustenna, Aripiprazole)
- Bipolar: 2 drugs to treat bipolar (Latuda, Aripiprazole)
- Epilepsy: 2 drugs to treat epilepsy (Lyrica, Vimpat)
- Lung disease: 6 drugs to treat lung disease (Advair Diskus, Spiriva, Symbicort, Spiriva Respimat, Anoro Ellipta, Incruse Ellipta)
- High Blood Pressure: 2 drugs to treat high blood pressure (Zetia, Bystolic)
- Diabetes: 19 drugs to treat diabetes (Januvia, Lantus Solostar, Lantus, Novolog Flexpen, Levemir Flextouch, Humalog Kwikpen U-100, Tradjenta, Invokana, Novolog, Trulicity, Janumet, Humalog, Toujeo Solostar, Levemir, Novolog Mix 70-30 Flexpen, Tresiba Flextouch U-200, Jardiance, Humalog Mix 75-25 Kwikpen, Welchol)
- HIV/AIDS: 7 drugs to treat HIV/AIDS (Genvoya, Triumeq, Tivicay, Truvada, Atripia, Prezista, Isentress)
- Hepatitis C: 3 drugs to treat Hepatitis C (Harvoni, Eclupsa, Zepatier)
- High cholesterol: 2 drugs to treat high cholesterol (Crestor, Welchol)
If the entire 125 top Part D drugs were selected, it would amount to a $90 billion tax increase on seniors' medicines over ten years based on the above research.
The 95 percent Pelosi tax applies to the entire market, not just Medicare Part D, so the overall tax hike would be far greater.
Because the Pelosi drug tax would not be deductible from income taxes, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that it could result in a manufacturer being taxed more than their total sales:
“the combination of income taxes and excise taxes on the sales could cause the drug manufacturer to lose money if the drug was sold in the United States.”
As an alternative to paying the tax, the CBO analysis stated that manufacturers could withdraw a drug from the market resulting in no revenue from the Pelosi tax:
“CBO and JCT anticipated that manufacturers would discontinue sales in the United States if the excise tax was levied on a drug, resulting in no revenue in that case.”
The 95 percent tax led over 70 groups and activists to write in opposition to the Pelosi plan.
As they noted, if the Pelosi plan were to become law it would dramatically change the American healthcare system in a way that will harm patients, innovators and providers.

Buttigieg Says He Will Raise Corporate Tax Rate to 35%
Posted by Adam Sabes on Sunday, October 20th, 2019, 8:25 PM PERMALINK
Pete Buttigieg said Sunday on Meet the Press that he would be “rolling back” the corporate tax rate “to the pre-Trump level.”
The pre-Trump level is 35 percent.
Here is the key exchange:
Chuck Todd: “What are some details on how you’re paying for you Medicare for All who want it?”
Buttigieg: “We score it out as $1.5 trillion over that period of time. The vast majority of that can be recovered by rolling back the corporate tax rate cut portion of the Trump tax cuts.”
Todd: “So, it will go from what to what.”
Buttigieg: “That will take care of the $1.4 trillion if we just revert to the pre-Trump level.”
Todd: “So you basically want to just roll back the entire corporate tax cut?”
Buttigieg: “Mmhmm” [nodding]
Before President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, the U.S. had the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world: 35 percent. The tax cuts permanently reduced the corporate tax rate to a more competitive 21 percent.
State corporate taxes average 6.0 percent across the U.S., so if Buttigieg reversed the tax cuts he would end up imposing a combined average corporate rate of 41 percent.
This would give the U.S. a much higher corporate tax rate than the United Kingdom (19 percent), China (25 percent), Canada (26.8 percent), and Ireland (12.5 percent). In fact, Buttigieg’s approach would impose a tax rate much higher than the current combined corporate rate across the 36 member Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD), which is currently 23.7 percent.
An increase in the corporate tax rate would also directly raise the cost of utility bills in all 50 states.
Buttigieg joins fellow Democrats Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O’Rourke, and Amy Klobuchar in calling for a corporate tax rate increase.

Watch: CNN Analyst Gets Visibly Irritated as Warren Dodges Tax Hike Question
Posted by Adam Sabes on Friday, October 18th, 2019, 5:00 PM PERMALINK
CNN’s chief political analyst was visibly irritated when Elizabeth Warren refused to answer the middle class tax question on Tuesday night after the CNN/New York Times debate.
Here’s the key exchange:
Gloria Borger: “But can you guarantee that what people might save on the cost of their health insurance would be more than what they might have to pay in additional taxes?”
Elizabeth Warren: dodge
Borger: “But what about the tax part of it? if there's an equation here…”
Warren: dodge
Warren dodged the middle class tax question six times during and after the CNN/New York Times debate, as Americans for Tax Reform previously noted.
Warren is avoiding the reality that middle-class Americans would have to pay more in taxes -- as Bernie Sanders notes is necessary -- to fund “Medicare for All.”
"Yeah, [we'd have to] raise taxes on the middle class," Sanders told a CNN reporter after the July debate.
Warren repeatedly dodged the question in September during an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. An exasperated Colbert tried to offer advice about the "taxes that perhaps you're not mentioning."
In July, Warren got into a heated exchange with MSNBC's Chris Matthews while refusing to answer Matthews' question on middle class tax hikes. She also dodged the question during the CNN and ABC debates.
In POLITICO Jeff Greenfield noted that Warren could be holding back an admission that Medicare for All will lead to higher taxes for the middle-class because she is worried about losing voters.
Greenfield wrote:
This leaves an obvious question that will follow her through the campaign: “Bernie Sanders is frank enough to acknowledge the obvious, and then explain it. Why won’t you?” The answer may be as simple as: If you say you will raise middle class taxes, an unmeasurable but likely significant number of voters simply will not bother to wait for the rest of your explanation.
As the Washington Post reported, Kenneth Thorpe, chairman of the health policy department at Emory University directly said that the plan will hit the middle class.
“There’s no question it hits the middle class,” he said.
As ATR noted earlier, Medicare for All would require anywhere from $32 trillion and $36 trillion in higher taxes over the course of the next decade.

ATR Supports the Compassionate Retirement Act
Posted by Tom Hebert on Friday, October 18th, 2019, 2:47 PM PERMALINK
Senators Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) recently introduced S.2495, the Kathryn Manginelli Act (or the Compassionate Retirement Act), legislation that allows families battling devastating diseases to withdraw their retirement savings without incurring a penalty. ATR supports this legislation and urges its passage.
Under current law, the disability exception allows the disabled to withdraw their retirement savings early without penalty if they are unable to work.
However, the exception does not cover Americans diagnosed with degenerative illnesses that continue working in the months prior to becoming fully disabled. Many Americans diagnosed with terminal diseases choose to work as much as possible during this period in order to allay future medical bills.
S.2495 expands the disability exception to cover American workers diagnosed with degenerative diseases. If implemented, terminally-ill workers would be allowed to withdraw their retirement savings without incurring a 10 percent penalty.
This change would provide much-needed financial stability to families affected by these diagnoses without raising taxes. The government should not tax Americans diagnosed with degenerative diseases for using their retirement contributions to defray medical costs.
S.2495 is a bipartisan piece of legislation that fixes this problem. Congress should pass it, and President Trump should sign it into law.

Andrew Yang to Elizabeth Warren: Wealth Tax Would Have “Massive Implementation Problems”
Posted by Adam Sabes on Friday, October 18th, 2019, 2:34 PM PERMALINK
Andrew Yang criticized Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax plan on Tuesday during the CNN/New York Times debate, stating that it would have “massive implementation problems” and would not “generate the revenue” projected.
Here’s the key exchange:
Erin Burnett: “Mr. Yang, your response. Would you impose a wealth tax?”
Yang: “Senator Warren is 100% right that we’re in the midst of the most extreme winner take all economy in history, and a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all of those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they had projected.”
Warren’s “wealth tax” has even been criticized by the Washington Post editorial board, noting it "conveys a certain authoritarian odor."
As Americans for Tax Reform previously stated, a wealth tax would empower IRS agents to keep a list of all household assets, which is extremely intrusive.
In addition, the Warren “wealth tax” would be ruled unconstitutional, and as Yang stated, the tax has been repealed by the following countries: Sweden, Denmark, The Netherlands, Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Italy.
These countries found the tax to be unworkable and economically harmful.

Klobuchar: I Would Repeal “Significant Portions” of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
Posted by Adam Sabes on Friday, October 18th, 2019, 10:40 AM PERMALINK
Amy Klobuchar said she would repeal “significant portions” of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the corporate tax rate, during the CNN/New York Times Democratic debate on Tuesday night.
“I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that helped the rich, including what [Trump] did with the corporate tax rate,” said Klobuchar.
Klobuchar’s promise to repeal the tax cuts is a promise to raise taxes. If the tax cuts were repealed:
- A family of four earning the median income of $73,000 would see a $2,000 tax increase.
- A single parent (with one child) making $41,000 would see a $1,300 tax increase.
- Millions of low and middle-income households would be stuck paying the Obamacare individual mandate tax.
- Utility bills would go up in all 50 states as a direct result of the corporate income tax increase.
- Small employers will face a tax increase due to the repeal of the 20% deduction for small business income.
- The USA would have the highest corporate income tax rate in the developed world.
- Taxes would rise in every state and every congressional district.
- The Death Tax would ensnare more families and businesses.
- The AMT would snap back to hit millions of households.
- Millions of households would see their child tax credit cut in half.
- Millions of households would see their standard deduction cut in half, adding to their tax complexity as they are forced to itemize their deductions and deal with the shoebox full of receipts on top of the refrigerator.
In Ohio, where the debate is, households who made the state average income of $54,021, received a tax cut of around $1,476.26, according to a recent Tax Foundation report.
Even left leaning news outlets confirm the good news about the GOP tax cuts:
CNN: “The facts are, most Americans got a tax cut.”
CNN: "In fact, estimates from both sides of the political spectrum show that the majority of people in the United States of America did receive a tax cut."
New York Times: "Most people got a tax cut."
Washington Post: “Most Americans received a tax cut.”
FactCheck.org: "Most people got some kind of tax cut in 2018 as a result of the law."
FactCheck.org: "The vast majority (82 percent) of middle-income earners — those with income between about $49,000 and $86,000 — received a tax cut that averaged about $1,050.
H&R Block: “The vast majority of people did get a tax cut.”
New York Times also noted the “sustained -- and misleading -- effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase.”
