Building remarkable custom desktops, gaming PCs, and workstation systems is our passion. It’s in our blood. This commitment to excellence coupled with over 20 years of experience in the industry is why our desktops and laptops have won dozens of awards from places like PC Magazine, CNET, Maximum PC, Cadalyst, and many others – an incredible 70+ awards in total over our storied history. Simply put, when you buy a Velocity Micro PC, you’re buying the very best. It's why dozens of major universities and Fortune 100 companies have chosen Velocity Micro PCs over our storied history.
We’ve had this success by focusing on just one thing – creating a remarkable PC experience. We use only premium components with no bloatware, meticulously assembled to outperform the competition. Our QA process is extensive, testing every inch of the PC to make sure it meets our own lofty standards before leaving our Richmond, VA facility. And the best part - every system includes free lifetime phone support from our in-house 100% US-based call center. For us, it’s the only way.
