With Trodat self-inking stamps, when the time comes to change the ink pad, simply click out the old pad and refill with stamp ink, or click in a new one! With IStamp pre-inked stamps, a few drops of oil-based ink will have you stamping again in no time! Trodat date stamps have individual, changeable number bands for month, date, and year.
We've tested Ideal, Cosco and Stamp-Ever, but chose the Trodat because of its superior quality and detailed features. The text-view window, durable core, comfortable grip, shock absorbers, and locking mechanisms are just a few of the reasons we chose this great product line.
