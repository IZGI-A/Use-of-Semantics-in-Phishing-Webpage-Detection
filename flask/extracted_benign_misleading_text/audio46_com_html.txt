Hugo TT 2
Chord's Hugo TT 2 benefits from an upgrade from a 4-element design to a 10-element design, which works in harmony with the radically upgraded FPGA and code to deliver unrivalled audio. A brand new high-power discreet output stage coupled with second-order noise-shaping integrated between the DAC output and filter is also employed to massively reduce distortion. Further improvements have also been made to the power delivery.
Hugo M Scaler
Chord's Hugo M Scaler brings the unrivalled advantages of ground-breaking FPGA-based WTA (Watts Transient Alignment) filtering technology to digitally connected audio devices, dramatically improving sound quality. Its compact form factor aligns with the TT (Table Top) series and has been designed to be stackable with other units in the range, including the Hugo TT 2, to form a highly advanced yet space-saving system.
