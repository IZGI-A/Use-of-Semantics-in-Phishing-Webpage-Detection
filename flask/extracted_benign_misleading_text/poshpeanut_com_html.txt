"My little needs these pajamas in every color!!! I ordered the 12-18 and she is 17lbs & a little over 27in and they were a little big, but the perfect amount of room to grow in to! The ruffles on the booty and the front is the perfect touch to these amazing pajamas. Softest ever. I always get so many comments on her Posh Peanut clothing!"

BEST swaddles I’ve found!
"Absolutely LOVE these swaddles. They’re so soft on baby’s skin and breathable. I ordered one to have at the hospital after delivery, and all of the nurses loved it and kept asking where I had gotten the swaddle set from! They said it was the talk of the Mother/Baby unit! I ordered a second swaddle set and a second robe for myself because I just love the fabric and quality of the product so much. I highly recommend!"
-Ashley E.
Gorgeous!!!
"I bought this gorgeous robe for my best friend who will be bringing my little niece into this world any day now! The material feels so amazing and the print is beautiful. With lots of things for the first time mama to buy lately, splurging on herself hasn't exactly been a top priority. I'm so happy that I was able to spoil her a bit with this gift! And not gonna lie, dying to have one for myself!!!"
-Jenny L.
Practical and Cute!
"I absolutely love this swaddle. We have so many different types of swaddles and we use this one 99% on the time. The quality of the fabric is so nice and soft, it is thick enough to keep our baby warm but not too thick where she would be hot. Also got the matching onesie and robe. Posh Peanut is such a great company!"
