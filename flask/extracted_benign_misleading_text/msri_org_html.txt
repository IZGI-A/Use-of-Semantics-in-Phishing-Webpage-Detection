When Shakespeare learned to spell
he didn’t ask whether it would someday lead to “King Lear.”
When Kepler learned to count
he didn’t ask whether it would explain the planets.
When Michelangelo learned to draw
no one said, “That doesn’t look like the Sistine Chapel.”
When Noether learned to multiply, no one said,
“What about primary decomposition?”
