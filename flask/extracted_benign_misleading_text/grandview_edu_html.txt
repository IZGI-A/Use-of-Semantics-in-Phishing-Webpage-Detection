The Viking Experience
When it comes to education, Grand View University means business...and biotechnology, and theatre and 40+ other majors and pre-professional programs. No matter which program you choose, you'll be immersed in the Viking culture. Our creative, innovative, hands-on learning style means that no two experiences are the same. It's all about making your education your own. Our theory? Learn what you love and you'll love to learn. #BeAViking
