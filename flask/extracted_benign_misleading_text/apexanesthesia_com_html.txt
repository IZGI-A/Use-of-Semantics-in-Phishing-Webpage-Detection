Kristen Brady, CRNA
Back to Basics Course
“I used APEX while I was a student and as a CRNA. The information is easy to access from my phone, tablet, and computer. I have even completed credits while on a plane! The content is explained in a way that keeps me interested (I especially love the flash cards). It was a seamless process to obtain CEUs. I highly recommend this product to CRNAs who like to go at their own pace to earn credits from anywhere.”
