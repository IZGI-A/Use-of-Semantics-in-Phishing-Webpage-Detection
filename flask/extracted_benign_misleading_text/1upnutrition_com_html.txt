What are BCAA‚Äôs?
.
Branch chained amino acids (BCAAs) are a group of 3 essential amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. ‚ÄúEssential‚Äù means they cannot be made by the body, so therefore have to come from an outside source. Let‚Äôs talk about the 3 essential amino acids that probably have heard of when one speaks of BCAAs.
.
Leucine is the primary BCAA, and this is where the most notoriety and benefit is given to. Leucine is the ‚Äúbig daddy‚Äù BCAA that helps promote protein synthesis, which is the signaling of the body to start rebuilding muscle.
.
Leucine is so effective it can be supplemented on its own, but studies show there are more overall benefits to supplementing it as a mixture with the other BCAAs. On a BCCA product you will always see the ‚Äúratio‚Äù, this can be a 2:1:1 ratio or higher like our BCAA which is 4:1:1. The first number in that ratio is designated for the amount of leucine compared to the other two BCAAs.
.
Isoleucine is second on the list. It has a different primary function than leucine in which it helps with glucose consumption and uptake which in return helps with energy production. Some studies have shown as well that it can act as a anticatabolic agent (prevent muscle breakdown). Some studies show that it can also help out with protein synthesis, but not nearly as effectively as leucine.
.
Valine is the last on the list of the BCAAs. Valine has been known to assist in preventing muscle breakdown, but nowhere in the realm of isoleucine, and it can assist in protein synthesis, but it is not even in the same mention as leucine and is still weaker in that aspect than isoleucine.

Carnosyn Beta Alanine is a naturally occurring amino acid that promotes strength, lean body mass and muscular endurance by supporting the pH of the muscle cells.

Some say timing is everything. Regardless, it is very important. Taking supplements at the proper time which is the most effective time is critical for maximum results. BCAAs are as adaptable as any supplement when it comes to when you take them. This has always brought some confusion to many people who take BCAAs. Maybe you have had people tell you to take them before your workout. Or maybe you see people drinking them during their workout. But since you could remember, you have taken them after your workout.
.
When looking at BCAAs, you need to first look at what their main purpose is. BCAAs are made up of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These 3 play into each other‚Äôs roles and responsibilities when it comes to building muscle. Leucine is the primary player when it comes to promoting muscle growth, with the other two helping out its function and purpose. Leucine by itself would still be valuable, while the other two left alone would not be so beneficial. BCAAs help out also with muscular endurance and recovery, which would imply taking them during a workout and after would be a benefit. And please note taking BCAAs before a workout would make the product present in the body and in a sense ‚Äúprime‚Äù the muscles to work.
So, which is best - before, during, or after?
BCAAs are all about muscle building, which cannot take place until recovery is initiated and started. With that being said, if a time had to be chosen to consume a BCAA product, after would be the most beneficiary. Once again, this is saying if only one time had to be chosen. Taking a BCAA product before a workout or even during are still beneficial and will only help in you reaching your goals, so do not stop taking them at those times if you have been, just get another serving in sometime after your workout as well (within an hour or so)
.
Our BCAA products also come with glutamine and hydration support and a special collagen formula in the women‚Äôs BCAAs, which helps out with skin, nail, and hair health and full joint support in the men's formula, which helps with joint support and recovery.

When should you take your Whey Protein Shake?
.
Read below üëá
.
Morning üëâ Sometimes we don't have the time to cook a delicious breakfast, especially on working days. Whey Protein powder mixed with oatmeal is a simple protein packed meal, that only takes 1 minute to prepare.
.
Meal Replacement üëâ If you find yourself on the verge of missing your upcoming meal, simply grab that tub of protein and have yourself 1-2 scoops with water. This is much more effective then skipping your meal all together since it will keep your metabolism working.
.
Post-Workout üëâ This is the most effective time when to have whey protein. Since solid foods take long to digest and to break down, it makes sense to drink a protein shake immediately following a workout, since protein shakes only take about 30 minutes to reach the muscle after digestion.
.
Bedtime üëâ Most of us have late night sweet cravings.. A whey protein shake at night will not only help you curb sweet cravings but it'll also keep you anabolic throughout the long night.

Protein is important, period. It is important to not only building muscle but also to maintaining a good immune system and healthy appearance. Lacking in protein is not only bad for achieving gains in the gym, but it is also dangerous to one‚Äôs overall health. Maybe you have wondered if you are lacking in protein. These are 5 signs that you may be protein deficient:
.
Bones are Weak: If you find yourself always fracturing or breaking a bone in either day to day activities or especially when you are exerting yourself in some kind physical activity, chances are you could be protein deficient. When the body is not getting what it needs in certain areas like the organs or tissue, it will pull from other areas such as skeletal tissue. Without the support of that skeletal tissue, bones are prone to injury
.
Hair and Nails Look Brittle: From more of a cosmetic standpoint, no one wants to look ‚Äúbrittle‚Äù in anything. If you lack protein, your hair and nails are one of the first places to show it. Protein is a very important component to nail and hair health, so lacking in it will show.
.
Muscles are Shrinking: This is maybe the most obvious. Protein is the building block to the muscle cells, so if you do not have enough protein in your daily diet, your muscles will begin to dwindle down.
.
Feel Tired: This is not usually noticed right away, but in time having too little protein will become to have adverse effects on your energy. This is because protein is present in your blood and helps carry oxygen to the muscles. So if you are not only lacking muscle but protein in the blood, you will begin to notice fatigue quickly
.
Always Getting Sick: This may be a surprise to some, but it is true. Protein is one of the major components to your body‚Äôs antibodies that help fight off unwanted invaders like viruses and bacteria. Too little protein means getting sick too often.
.
Studies show fitness enthusiast, bodybuilders and athletes should get around 1-1.2 grams of protein per body weight to build and maintain muscle. Shake, Bake or On the Go no matter how you like to take your protein we got you covered with our 4 protein products: 1UP Whey, 1UP ISO, Vegan protein, and 1UP bars!
What‚Äôs powering up your workouts?! We believe that you should feed your body nothing but the absolute best! This is why you need to look into our All in one 1UP pre workout for women.
