I went ahead and became a member here this year because the price was more than reasonable on an annual basis.
Since I joined back in August of this year, I've played 11 rounds on it so far.
My parents have a house off of one of the tee boxes and I was around when they played the LPGA events back in the early 2000s. This course has gone through some times but has... » More

My parents have a house off of one of the tee boxes and I was around when they played the LPGA events back in the early 2000s. This course has gone through some times but has always presented a humbling challenge. If you're not accurate, it will penalize you.
The course conditions seem to be on the mend this summer and fall. The tee boxes need some love but they offer various angles that make you rethink your strategy, especially when the wind kicks in during the late afternoons. Fairways offer relatively clean lies, and the greens can vary from slow to slick depending on the hole and its ability to drain water.
I usually play in the weekday afternoons as either a single or a twosome, and PoP in the last 4 rounds has been about 3:30. I rarely see a golf cart with drinks, and I've yet to see a marshal. The club stays busy with lots of tournaments and visiting golfers. I know Blue Rock is about to go through some changes, so I expect a lot of the local Vallejo golfers will transition over since it'll be the only course left in town, after Montara, and Mare Island have since closed down.
I definitely like playing here with the arrangement I have. It is not long, but it IS challenging, so when I go play other courses, they definitely don't seem to be as difficult.
Great, unique golf for the price for sure.

Played today. First off POP 3 H. The course is in terrific shape, though some of the tee boxes have yet to fill in completely (but no issue with teeing it up). Fairways were wonderful (nice and wide) with great lies and roll, all round. Was able to avoid the traps, but they looked fine and heard no complaints. Very little rough at present just outside the fairways, but many OB/... » More

Fairways were wonderful (nice and wide) with great lies and roll, all round. Was able to avoid the traps, but they looked fine and heard no complaints. Very little rough at present just outside the fairways, but many OB/ESA areas do come into play. Greens were in top shape, void of divots (advantage of going first) and chipped/putted with speed, all round (practice green was evidence of what one would expect). Customer service top notch at all levels. Fantastic course, great layout and very reasonably priced. Highly recommended.

I play here weekly and the course has been in great shape (for what it is - a muni) for the past few months. Greens are really quite good - soft, smooth and relatively fast. Fairways are mostly lush and playable with a handful of spots that are bare/GUR. There's been improvement in the tee boxes lately and I'd rate them as average at this point.

I play here weekly and the course has been in great shape (for what it is - a muni) for the past few months. Greens are really quite good - soft, smooth and relatively fast. Fairways are mostly lush and playable with a handful of spots that are bare/GUR. There's been improvement in the tee boxes lately and I'd rate them as average at this point. Rough is fairly short and thin, with many large stretches of hardpan once you get into the deep rough. It's a walkable course and a nice setting nestled between Cowles Mountain and Lake Murray. The back nine is especially scenic (holes 11-13) and plays along Lake Murray for stretches. Overall the course is in probably the best shape I've ever seen it in, so now's the time to get out and give it a shot.
