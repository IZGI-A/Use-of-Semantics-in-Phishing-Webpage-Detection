THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF PODCASTS
Humans have been telling stories since the beginning of time. It fuels education, entertainment and emotion. This style pulls the listener into the world of your own creation. Because of this world creation this style tends to be the heaviest in production.
The most common style of podcasts are interviews (and the easiest). It allows individuals and companies to position themselves as thought leaders in any industry by eliciting creative conversations with others.
Just like flipping through a magazine: a little of this and a little of that. Find an overall subject and doing a mixture of solo, interview and storytelling. This is a great style for pods with boat loads of information to share.
