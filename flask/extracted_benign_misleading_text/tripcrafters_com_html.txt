TripCrafters Terms and Conditions
IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. The following terms and conditions ("Terms") apply to the use of TripCrafters.com ("Website") including the Trip Request services offered on the Website (the "Services"). By accessing and using this Website, you agree to each of the terms and conditions ("Terms") set forth herein. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Website or Services.
The terms "you" and "user" as used herein refer to all individuals and/or entities accessing the Website or using the Services for any reason.
Trip Request Service
If you submit your contact information and trip details through the Website (a "Trip Request"), TripCrafters will pass your Trip Request to up to three Travel Agents (as defined below); except that if one of the Travel Agents is unable to service your itinerary, TripCrafters may submit your Trip Request to additional Travel Agents until such time as you have been connected with three Travel Agents that may service your Trip Request.
By submitting your Trip Request, you authorize TripCrafters to pass your Trip Request to Travel Agents and you are expressly inviting Travel Agents to contact you by telephone or email according to the preferences submitted by you at the numbers and email addresses you have provided in the Trip Request. You hereby consent to any such calls even if your phone number is on any Do Not Call list. By submitting a Trip Request, you furthermore authorize TripCrafters to follow up with you with respect to a Trip Request submitted by you and to contact you regarding any future TripCrafters promotions or services.
There is no charge to you for submitting a Trip Request. TripCrafters is paid a fee by participating Travel Agents for passing on your Trip Request and by submitting a Trip Request you hereby agree to this.
For the purposes of these terms, a "Travel Agent" is any person or entity who acts as an agent or a supplier of, sells or offers for sale any travel, transportation or vacation related services or arrangements.
What TripCrafters Does Not Do
TRIPCRAFTERS IS NOT A TRAVEL AGENT. TripCrafters does not endorse or recommend the products or services of any particular Travel Agent.

You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any Travel Agent or Other Party.
TripCrafters does not pre-screen Travel Agents. The Trip Request service relies on statements made by Travel Agents and user feedback and reviews to determine which Travel Agents to include in its database.
