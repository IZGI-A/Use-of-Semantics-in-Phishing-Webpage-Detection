can affect anyone
What you need to know about depression
Depression is a common illness worldwide, with more than 300 million people affected. Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in everyday life. Depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. (World Health Organization, WHO, 2017).
Depression is an illness that involves not only the mind or brain but the whole body, affecting the way a person eats, sleeps, feels about himself or herself, and thinks about things. It is not a passing, normal, state of mind and it is neither a sign of personal weakness nor a condition that one can "snap out of".
In general, depression can affect anyone: men and women from all backgrounds, in all professions, and at all stages of life. Even people whose lives seem carefree and contented can experience depression.
Depression can be treated. If you think you have depression, seek help.
