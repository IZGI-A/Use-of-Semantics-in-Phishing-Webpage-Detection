BE THE EYES AND EARS OF THE COMMUNITY.
Helping to make our area a safer place is every resident's responsibility.
Our Vision is to make Durbanville the safest place in the Western Cape. By joining your fellow neighbours in the Kendal Road Neighbourhood Watch you are kept in the loop about local issues, such as crime, safety, and community events and share in the benefits of a safe neighbourhood. As a free service, we can email crime alerts and community news right to your inbox, and you can choose both what to receive and the frequency at which you wish to receive it, so why not join now and keep informed! PLEASE REPORT ALL CRIME TO SAPS - LESS REPORTED INCIDENTS = FEWER RESOURCES. The more cases that are opened, the more resources are allocated to our stations.
We are looking forward for your support.
