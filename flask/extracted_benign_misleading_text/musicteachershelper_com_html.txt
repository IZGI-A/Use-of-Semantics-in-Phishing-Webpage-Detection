Save time and money with an automated studio.
Spend more time teaching
When you have a process for handling scheduling, cancellations, makeups, event reminders, lessons notes, and all the other sometimes tedious tasks of managing your students, you will save a ton of time. Less time and energy spent on those tasks means more dedicated time to connect with your students.
Be confident about your rates with professional looking invoices that can be sent automatically with payment reminders. Accept credit card and even set up recurring charges so you never miss a payment again. And now that you're spending less time managing your teaching studio, you'll have time to increase your student roster and earn more!
Make a great first impression
Adding your studio information into one of the professionally designed website themes is as easy as writing an email. Upload audio to your own file area for your students to access. Email some or all of your students with a few clicks and post public or private studio announcements.
