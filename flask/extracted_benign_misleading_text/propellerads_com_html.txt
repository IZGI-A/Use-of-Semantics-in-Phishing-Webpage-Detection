"As an affiliate I come across advertising networks on daily basis. It is very rare to find a traffic network with high quality traffic and superb customer support. However, I am happy to recommend PropellerAds as being one of the few that you don’t want to miss if you are looking for high quality traffic and great customer support!"

"I'm working with PropellerAds for many years already, and for me it's 100% the best POP/PUSH source. When I want to test new GEOs or Offers, I always start in PropellerAds, because I'm sure the quality will be amazing and the ROI will be green. Also, there are good people who can always help you and share some tips, some of them I know in person."

"PropellerAds is one of my very favorite sources for pop traffic. The very few other networks that have even comparable quality, do not have PropellerAds' volume; and those that have comparable volume, can't match its quality. You'll be hard-pressed to find another source with the same quality and volume. This is the network I suggest for all affiliates that run pop traffic to buy traffic from."
