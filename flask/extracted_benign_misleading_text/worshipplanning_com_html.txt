Smart Features for All Plans.
worshipplanning.com's easy-to-use tools and intuitive functionality make quick work of organizing, planning, and scheduling your next service, your next series, or even the upcoming year! All features are included in every subscription plan.
Worship Flow Editor
The plans for this Sunday are vital to you and your team. You need a tool that lets you easily specify every detail, and lets your team get to that information.
Worshipplanning's intuitive drag-and-drop worship flow editor allows you to plan the fine details, or just a general set list. Click "read more" to see how you really need more than a simple text editor to effectively plan your worship service.
People & Scheduling
No doubt, volunteers are the key ingredient to success on Sunday mornings. Keep everyone on the same page with our advanced scheduling tool.
Schedule individuals one at a time or as entire teams—based on availability and qualifications—with a single drag-and-drop action. Once scheduled, volunteers are notified via email, text, or even Facebook to respond.

Virtual Sheet Music
Replace the sheet music mess of paper and binders with OnSong for your iPad, iPhone, or iPod. By integrating your OnSong app with worshipplanning, you can import the song files you need in just a few seconds.
OnSong is the gold standard in virtual sheet music apps. Use it to transpose, annotate, rehearse, and perform your music. It even works with AirTurn wireless foot pedals to flip your vitual pages. Sounds magical? It is!
Presentation Options
It is easy to go from worship flow to slides with a couple options at your disposal. Our integration with Proclaim Church Presentation Software makes building your presentation a snap. Or, if you use another program, slides can be centrally stored with each song in your library, then easily downloaded by your tech team to merge together.
Our integration with Proclaim makes building slides easier than ever. Proclaim will even recognize any song mapping you've set, and build your slides accordingly. Proclaim has created a brief demonstration of how easy it is.
Other Integrations
By integrating with other systems, you get functionality that is both deep and wide. Our list of systems with which worshipplanning integrates is constantly growing. And we always welcome new integration requests!

"Before I tried WorshipPlanning.com, I was making schedules in Excel and we just had a file cabinet with the music to all our songs in it. Once I tried the free trial, it was a no brainer for me! The scheduling feature is amazing and easy to use. The fact that all the songs, music, recordings are all in one place for me and my team to work with has improved the preparedness of everyone. All in all, it makes my life SO much easier!!!" - Shannon B.
