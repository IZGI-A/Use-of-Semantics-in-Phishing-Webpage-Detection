We exist to provide our members a powerful platform on which to proactively & effectively process the multitude of urgent, demanding business issues faced daily in an expanding globally competitive marketplace. We meet monthly as a group to share ideas, think together about how to solve the challenges we face, as well as celebrate the successes of our members.
“We are in business TO CHANGE THE WORLD OF WORK. We are working toward a future reality where the number of healthy companies, cohesive teams and fulfilled employees outnumbers those that aren’t.”
Patrick Lencioni & The Table Group
We also put on leadership events that we believe will be life giving for the local business community.
