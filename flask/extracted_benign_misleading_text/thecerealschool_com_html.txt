OLD SCHOOL CEREAL MADE THE NEW WAY
In an act of pure magic, we've reinvented the sugary cereals from childhood by replacing the carbs and sugar with high-quality protein and monk fruit (a natural sweetener with zero sugar). No gluten or grains. No long ingredient list with big words. Just a sweet, delightful crunch that will transport you right back to childhood.

STARTED BY TWO BIG KIDS WHO NEVER GREW UP
It started in our 450 sqft apartment after we were told by food industry "experts" that our idea was impossible. We didn't let the haters hold us back from dreaming big. Now, we have tens of thousands of customers across the country who've helped make our dream a reality.
