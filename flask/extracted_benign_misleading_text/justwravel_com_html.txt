It has been very pleasant and cheerful experience to Parashar lake trek with JustWravel. After we have reached meeting point at Bagi, we were warmly welcomed by JustWravel team and trip started as per given scheduled time. Despite the fact we were so tired after long journey, JustWravel team made us so comfortable and offer us clean washrooms to get fresh and yummy nutritious breakfast initially. Then they have offered us packed lunch which was hygienic and tasty. Since the trek was difficult however Mr. Rahbar (uff Ray) boost all participants with positive energy. One good part was JustWravel team was really equipped with excellent communication system, Medical emergency kit, safety guidelines and many more. Once we have reached first day destination to Base Camp, they offered us unexpected very good snacks and Tea, which was amazing as after lots of energy loss during the trekking. Next day morning we have again started as per given schedule after healthy and nutritious breakfast. Trek was so difficult due to heavy snow but once we have reached our destination it was so amazingly beautiful place then JustWravel team organised then we have started our journey back to village. While coming down many of our participants were exhausted however JustWravel team really taking care of all the participants. We all came down safe and sound and we all again get refreshed after taking bath and yummy food. From beginning till end all trek was covered as per giving schedule which was great. I must say if you booked with JustWravel you will always feel safe and get many surprises by good food like Rajmah Chawal, Tea ,Puri aaloo and many more at above sea level. I must recommend all hiking lover must try JustWravel once and make your trekking memorable.Special Thanks to Rahbar (uff Ray).
Hats off to the Just Wravel team for taking travellers' experience so so seriously!! This was my first trip with the team to Prashar lake and they turned it into my best ever. Comfortable travel, simple yet lip smacking food, clean accomodation and absolutely amazing hospitality! Our package didn't include any evening snack and yet we were welcomed warmly at the campsite in the evening with hot tea, freshly made pakoras and a bonfire! The trip guides were well trained, knowledgeable, caring and went out out their way to make our stay not only enjoyable, but also safe. Definitely recommending to other travellers.Special shout out to our ever energetic, ever motivating, ever calm and extremely caring trek guide Rahbar Alam who took the entire experience to the next level. Keep it up!!
A huge thanks to our trek leader Shadab Ahmed and local guide Ajay these people made me live one of the best days of my life. As Shadab is very friendly, supportive and helpful.. as he carried my bag when i was really struggling in climbing terrain.. and unfortunately, I forgot my phone at the view point so Shadab ran up hill and got my phone back. This was my first ever trek.. was challenging and inspired me to conquer new heights again.. surely looking forward to.. trek again... with JustWravel and a nice leader like him.
The most experienced and well-equipped Travel Organizers of all time. They do deliver what they commit. Best part is that their Trek Leader/Tour Leader easily foresee things and manage the schedule accordingly. Before the tour, I wasn't sure if I would be able to make it to my office on Monday but All credit to our Tour Leader - Rahbar Alam *The Rockstar*. He proved to be the One-Man Army. Think anything related to tour and He is their with his full-proof escape plan. I wish to be accompanied by Rahbar Bhai for my next tour which I'm gonna plan with JustWravel soon. I have done more than 10-12 Treks but This Prashar Lake Trek with JustWravel Team proved to be the Best and Unforgettable of them all. Thanks for the never fading memories Team JustWravel.

Trip to Chopta....Amazing experience!!...Our guides Shadab and Rehbar ...Wonderfull guys!!....Even though couldn't make it to the destination because of weather issues but still had amazing time there....and ofcourse the team members, would love to go on a trekk with you guys again.
I had my first trekking experience with JustWravel to Nag Tibba. We experienced snow after the base camp. Just Wravel managed it really well, guides were very helpful and cooperative, food and tents provided were good too. Although gitters were not provided still we managed to reach the summit without any injury to anyone. Overall the experience was amazing.
I have done 3 trips till now with justwravel and all of them have been great. First one was a solo trek and I can vouch for justwravel that any trip with them will become a great memory with new friends and experiences. Food and stay are great. If you are looking to join a group or have a group of your own and need an organized trip, contact them and they will do it with ease! Trek and trip leads are accommodating and concerned.
