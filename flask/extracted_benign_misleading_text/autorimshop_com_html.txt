A very pleasant experience dealing with these people. Timing, delivery, pricing, communication, and delivery all beyond expectation. Most unusual nowadays to deal with anyone over the internet that get it right the first time! Their product is A-1 and the people working together to make it all happen seamlessly really deserve recognition. Great job Auto Rim Shop!
Most inexpensive Jeep Rim and Tire Pressure Sensor on the Web. Found out that I did not need the Tire Sensor I purchased. I Contacted the shop and they sent me a Free Shipping Label via E-Mail while I was still on the phone to return the item. Funds were back into my account 3 days later. Very Good Prices and Customer Service (Marie) was an absolute pleasure to work with!!! You guys are great!! 5 Star Outfit
My granddaughter recently damaged a rim that had to be replaced. An order was placed for a new aluminum rim which arrived the next day with zero shipping cost and at a very reasonable price. Impressive!
