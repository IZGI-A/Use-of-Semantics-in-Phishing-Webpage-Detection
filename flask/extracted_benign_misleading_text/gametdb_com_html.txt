If we had a member of the month for November it would be a tough choice because we have two of them. Both of them instantly joined the top 10 contributor list for the Wii category. Stallion has scanned covers and discs for all of his GameCube collection which is nothing less than every single PAL game released on that system. As a result, English/PAL GameCube artwork is now complete on GameTDB, including disc artwork. Mastershoes has also spent countless hours upgrading and creating many WiiWare cover for your enjoyment.
You can now upload artwork for WiiWare and Virtual Console games as "title (custom)".
