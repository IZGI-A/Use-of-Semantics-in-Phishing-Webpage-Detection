Taking a break...
Unfortunately, in a few weeks time, Dougie's Threads will be taking a break for the forseeable future.
No, i'm not pregnant again!
I am going to focus my time on developing my education.
I will be holding sales and discounts over the next few weeks to try and get rid of as much stock as possible...
I hope to be back in the future...
Thank you all for you're continued support over the years xxxx
CLOSING DOWN 8TH NOVEMBER 2020
So as you all know we used to make and sell children and Baby clothing. Unfortunately due to work and time, this is no longer feesable. We have decided to re-open the store selling personalised and custom made clothing. All clothes are brought from a wholesaler and are not made on site. All degisns are made on site!
