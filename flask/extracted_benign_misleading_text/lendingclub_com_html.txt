Checking your rate generates a soft credit inquiry, which is visible only to you. A hard credit inquiry that may affect your credit score only appears when your loan is issued.
LendingClub Notes are not FDIC insured • not guaranteed • may lose value
LendingClub Member Payment Dependent Notes (Notes) are offered by prospectus.
Investors should review the risks and uncertainties described in the prospectus carefully prior to investing. Historical performance is
not a guarantee of future results and investors may lose some or all of the principal invested.
LendingClub does not provide investment, tax, or legal advice. You should consult your legal, tax, and/or investment professional prior
to making any financial or investment decision. While returns are dependent upon borrower payments of principal and interest, Note
holders do not have a security interest in the corresponding loans or loan proceeds. Notes are unsecured obligations of LendingClub.
Returns may be impacted by, among other things, the number and attributes of Notes owned, as well as macroeconomic and other conditions.
