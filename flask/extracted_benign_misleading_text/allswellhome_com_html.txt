Soft yet supportive.
Believe the reviews!
Great mattress. I was a little skeptical of all the good reviews, but this actually delivered! I’m usually a firm-mattress kinda gal, and this was firm enough to support me, yet soft enough on top to relieve pressure points. For reference I’m 5’7 and 110lb. Would recommend to others for sure.
