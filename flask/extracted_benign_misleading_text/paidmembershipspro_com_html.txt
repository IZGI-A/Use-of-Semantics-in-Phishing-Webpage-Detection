Sites running Paid Memberships Pro use it to:
Manage professional organizations with thousands of members.
Get paid for e-learning and digital courseware.
Accept recurring payment for content, podcasts, video, and more.

No other membership plugin is as customizable as Paid Memberships Pro. I’m able to help my members move forward in their careers by designing a site around their needs – not around the capabilities of the plugin.
