Thayer Prescott, a veteran-owned small business, is located in Frisco, Texas and is a sole proprietorship.
The practice offers fractional consulting services to clients (from start-ups to Fortune 500 corporations) with proven knowledge, experience, and expertise to elevate any organization’s post-9/11 transitioning military/veteran hiring program. Fractional services gives our clients the freedom to call on us for our expertise only when needed at a very reasonable cost.
I seek to engage with corporate leadership teams and HR professionals who understand the value that our nation's post-9/11 military heroes (from highly skilled technicians to General/Flag Officers) bring to an employer and appreciate their skill sets which appeal to employers of all industries around the United States.
My nearly four decades of combined unique U.S. Army leadership, Department of Defense management consulting, transitioning military-to-civilian executive search, and national veteran service organization (VSO) leadership experience gives me the knowledge and expertise to guide you and your team like no other firm.
I welcome the opportunity to serve you.
