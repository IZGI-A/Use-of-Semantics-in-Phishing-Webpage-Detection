Welcome to the Intercontinents
Welcome to the world of floating continents which will feature tales from all genres. We're excited after several years of planning and dedication, to bring you our first work, The Assassin of Malcoz√©, by Bryan Asher.
Our books are well paced adventures that hearken back to pulp stories like: Solomon Kane, Elric, and Louis L'Amour, while adding a flare of modern style action and character progression like The Dark Elf Trilogy or The Evertide.
Our mission with these novels is simple; you can jump into our books as shallow or deep as you like. We want anyone to be able to pick one up and get started, without needing an encyclopedia. However, for those who want to become entrenched in the world of the Intercontinents, we will provide fun updates to the site with additional lore and detail.
Thank you to all our future readers, we're excited to share our stories with you.
