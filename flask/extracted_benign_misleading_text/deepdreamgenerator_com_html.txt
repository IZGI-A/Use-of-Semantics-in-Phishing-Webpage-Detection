Create inspiring visual content in a collaboration with our AI enabled tools
1. Deep Style
The technique is a much more advanced version of the original
Deep Dream approach. It is capable of using its own knowledge
to interpret a painting style and transfer it to the uploaded image.
2. Thin Style
This tool is a simplified version of the Deep Style one. It is not
capable of creating advance transformations but it still shines with some
exceptional results. It is also noticeably faster than the Deep Style.
3. Deep Dream
Initially it was invented to help scientists and engineers
to see what a deep neural network is seeing when it is
looking in a given image. Later the algorithm has become
a new form of psychedelic and abstract art.
