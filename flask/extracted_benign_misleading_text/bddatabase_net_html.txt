|Our server engineer left the team. He was caught on advertising on the site without my knowledge, in their own interests. He changed the passwords on the server and put forward conditions if I do not re-register the domains and the server, he will separate and work himself, because he has everything he needs. Fortunately, we managed to quickly restore access to the server and prevent him from cleaning up with him. Now he tries to justify himself and pour mud on my name.
We are updating the site. And we will continue to work.
Stay with us.
