Glew is a great tool for pulling all of our ecommerce data into one place. It's easy to use, easy to integrate, and their support is top-notch. They've been consistently improving the product and releasing new features since we signed up, so I'm sure it's just going to continue to get better.
This extension has allows us to analyze product mix and historical data to make informed decisions quickly. New Merchandise Reporting tool is fantastic addition!
Highly recommended! The Glew extension offers us analytics that we can't get anywhere else. We've used them for everything from purchasing, to merchandising, and just recently ran a marketing campaign targeted to our Lost Customers that was extremely successful. I can't recommend this product enough.
The Glew extension was the tool we were looking for to address critical business reporting questions that Google Analytics and Magento alone could not answer. There are so many BI tools on the market - this reporting tool/dashboard is easy to implement and see immediate reporting that merges Magento and Google Analytics data.
