LawnStarter has been phenomenal with their communication the whole 8 months we've been using them. Love the notifications and the app in general. Our home looks beautiful and we don't have to worry about a thing!
So convenient! It took less than ten minutes for me to schedule lawn mowing service online, and the work the lawn crew did was fantastic. Additionally, their customer service is very prompt and professional. I highly reccomend LawnStarter!
The crew that does my lawn is friendly, professional, and efficient. Unlike many local lawn mowing services, they have paid meticulous attention to detail around my edges and flower beds. It’s also great being able to manage things through the app.

Lawnstarter has been an essential part of my company's growth. I went from 10-15 maintenance clients to 150+ maintenance clients at the peak of the season.Andrew W. at Terra-Dura
