Regain Control in Just 3 Days
When you're constantly dealing with discipline problems, always struggling to keep control, teaching is pretty stressful. And let's be honest - you're not nearly as effective as you'd like to be.
But it doesn’t have to be that way. You CAN learn to control your classroom & make meaningful connections with your students. And this minicourse will show you how.
Hi, I’m Linda Kardamis
I always wanted to be teacher, but a few months in, I realized teaching was a whole lot harder than I thought it would be. Too many of my students just weren’t listening to me; many were outright belligerent. My confidence plummeted, and as much as I hated to admit it, I wasn’t enjoying teaching. Instead, I felt like a failure in my own classroom.
But God wasn’t done with me. Through sound advice, a bit of trial and error, and much prayer, I gradually learned to keep my students’ attention, and I started to believe I could actually do this.
As I stopped living in fear of the next problem, I began to look forward to teaching. And while I loved those ah-ha moments when my students finally got how to solve equations, the truest joy came from watching God change lives through me.
No matter what challenges you’re facing, God wants to use you in your classroom. You’re in the right place. Let’s dive in.
