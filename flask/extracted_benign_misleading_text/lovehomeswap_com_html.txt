We swapped with a five-bedroom villa right opposite the marina and even traded cars. The weather was beautiful and the kids loved it. It was just an amazing holiday

We hit the jackpot with Love Home Swap. Our swappers offered to pick us up, gave us great 'must do' lists and stayed with us for a lovely dinner! What hotel does that for free? All of this and close up views of the Eiffel Tower from our huge balcony!

Absolutely stunning property and lovely swapper! Cecilia is a sweetheart and very accommodating. We look forward to have a second visit sometime in the future. For anyone who likes golfing this is ideal as the course is basically inside the property. Gorgeous chateaux!

We swapped homes with Andrea for 11 weeks. She is considerate and caring and we valued our swap experience with her and the boys. A fabulous, 5-star home with oodles of room. The area is exclusive and peaceful, yet you could visit and dine in 3 counties in the one day without a rush
