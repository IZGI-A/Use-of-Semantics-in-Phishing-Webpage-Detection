I got this Jikko Damascus Santoku from Kaz, and this is my favorite knife from my collection. I feel the steel is quite hard and gives you great edge after sharpening. I believe that food’s taste is better when it’s cut with good knives. If you maintain your knife properly it lasts over 10, 20 years. It might be a bit pricy for home knives but that's worth it.

I had a few other Japanese knives before and they cost me anywhere from $300 to $500, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised that the Jikko Damascus I got was by far the cheapest and it held its own among my other collections. The knife maintained its sharpness for a lengthy two weeks without having to put it to the stone and the scallops on the knife prevents any ingredients sticking.

It’s obvious that the quality of Japanese knives are the best. I’ve been working as a chef more than 10 years and always wanted good Japanese knives. Now I got my new knife, Jikko damascus from Sakai. I’m quite impressed with this quality. This knife gives me good weight on the blade and easy grip so I feel less fatigued even after working long hours.
