Creating a Straw Poll - It Was Never Easier
If you want to create a simple poll to vote on for your friends, family, colleagues or followers, you are at the right place. Our straw polls are optimized for mobile screens and work seamlessly on every device. And the best part: It's completely free!
It's important to know that you can analyze the results of the poll, but you can't see who voted for which option in particular. That's not what StrawPoll.com is made for, this place is just for creating instant, quick and anonymous polls.
