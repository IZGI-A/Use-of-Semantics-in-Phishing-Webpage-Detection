Playing a DVD is not as easy as it seems. Even if you have a third-party DVD decoder installed on Windows Media Player, you may get certain DVD playback failures such as region error (e.g. cannot play DVD purchased in the UK in the USA), optical DVD drive is unable to read a disc, playback is choppy, the new DVD is noisy, and many more. You may also receive error messages like ‘Windows Media Player can’t play DVD because of digital copy protection’, ‘VLC can’t set the DVD’s title’, ‘can’t decode disk from Windows DVD player’, etc.
If you are wondering what is the solution to all these DVD decode problems, and rip DVDs to videos with WinX DVD Ripper Platinum.
