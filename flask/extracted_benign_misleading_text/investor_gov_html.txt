Red Flags of Fraud
What You Can Do To Avoid Investment Fraud
Researchers have found that investment fraudsters hit their targets with an array of persuasion techniques that are tailored to the victim's psychological profile. Protect your investments by watching out for these red flags:
- It sounds too good to be true
- "Guaranteed returns" (they don't exist)
- The "halo" effect, which makes con artists seem likable or trustworthy
- "Everyone is buying it" pitches
- Pressure to send money right now
- Small favors (free lunch or workshop)
