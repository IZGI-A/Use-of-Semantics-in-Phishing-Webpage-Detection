VPP
NABP's Verified Pharmacy Program (VPP) streamlines the process for pharmacies obtaining or renewing licensure in multiple states. VPP assists applicants with meeting inspection requirements and allows for the distribution of necessary information to the boards where a new or renewed license is being sought.
