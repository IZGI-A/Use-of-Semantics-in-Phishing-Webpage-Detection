We have written an in-depth guide on how to get started with cricket betting online. You can read it in full here: how to bet on cricket
There are plenty of variations to this method where you can use other deposit options, choose other betting sites and so on, but the basic process is the same for whatever way you choose to get setup.
It depends on which region you are living in. Regions like the UK for example have fully legalized online betting and you can create an account, deposit money, bet on cricket and withdraw your winnings without any problems.
Other places, like India for example, it is more of a gray area. Here the laws don't explicitly state that it is illegal and this varies by region. Still there are plenty of betting sites that allow you to bet with real money online. It is hard to enforce such a law, and many countries don’t even do it, but if you decide to go ahead with betting anyways understand the risks that you are taking on. Always read up on your local laws regarding online betting.
This is completely normal and should not leave you worried. The betting sites needs to comply with laws and regulations in their country they operate from and they need to make sure there are real people that are behind the accounts being made. This is to stop money laundering, funding of terrorists and other illegal activites.
Deciding on which site you want to use for sports betting is as simple as figuring out what you want from a bookmaker. If you are from India, Betway a top choice as far as cricket betting goes. You want to bet using a specific currency, like Indian rupees for example? No problem! Bet365 can accommodate your needs.
We have written reviews on most of the popular online sportsbooks and we have listed those that have been given the highest rating by our team in the table above called 'Top Bookmakers'. You can get a quick glance of their standing with us, their welcome offering, link to our full review of them and a link so you can visit their site. If you want to just get started you can find one you like the look of above and start betting on cricket right away!
There are several different factors to consider when you are researching a bookmaker, for example:
If this seems like a time consuming job, thats because it is. But you can relax, we have done a more in-depth study of the sportsbooks we use to bet on cricket online on this site. Go to our cricket betting sites page for an overview over the online sportsbooks we have tried and tested and read our review of them. We talk about the most important features of them and what we like about them in that section.
Yes, you can! But will you? Sadly, probably not. Sports betting is a business for the operators that offer it, and they are not doing this just for the love of the sport. That means that you have a big hill to climb in trying to outsmart someone that is making boatloads of money on losing bettors and employ hundreds of people to make sure the odds is set correctly.
For you to end up a winner cricket betting you need to have patience, bet within your means and have a knack for analyzing betting odds. You cannot rely on simple systems or go with your gut on games, that is not enough to outsmart bookmakers with their huge databases of statistics and knowledge of the sport.
But even though you are probably not going to win, that does not have to make a difference. We are not winners on every sport we follow and most of us even keep a "fun-fund" where we just place bets for fun and try to put our wits to battle with the best oddsmakers in the hopes of winning. It is a lot more fun than grinding away at betting. Sure, we might be losing money, but what kind of entertainment doesn't cost money? And that is what betting should be: entertaining and fun!
All the different countries and regions around the world have their own laws and regulations when it comes to online betting. Betting is legal in the UK for example, but illegal in the US, but not on a state level. Some states are opening up for online gambling, but this brings aboard a whole nother set of problems. The same goes for a region like India where the laws are still unclear and some regions allow it while others don't.
What is clear though is that depositing and withdrawing funds from betting sites online can be a hassle depending on where you are from. Using your credit card(s) is quite easy, but sometimes there are fees attached to this and not everyone is comfortable giving out this information to websites. That is why we recommend to use ewallets. These are forms of internet bank accounts (or ewallets) that function just like a normal bank account, but they are operated purely online. The big advantage with these is that they are swift in depositing and withdrawals and have low to none fees associated with them. Makes life as a bettor a lot easier.
We recommend that you check out some of these options:
If everything else seems to fail and you are unable to deposit funds you can always ask the customer service at the site you are trying to deposit at for help, they will usually know best what could be the issue and which option would be the best for your situation.
