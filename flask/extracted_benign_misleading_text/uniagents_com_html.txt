UNIAGENTS SYSTEM DEMO
UniAgents is a leading technology outfit, which helps Institutions, Consultants and High Schools and
Government agencies in utilising technology to meet their international student mobility goals. To
understand how your organisation can benefit from our services, you must book a consultation session
with one of our advisors. The advisor will look into your requirements and based on that you will
receive a set of recommendations that will help you in making a wise decision over choosing a
subscription plan. In case we are not able to provide a service as per your requirements we will be
pleased to direct you towards any independent third party services in our knowledge (not associated to
us in any manner). We aim to build the relationship with our partners.
The consultation session includes the full demonstration of the technology system using digital screen
sharing method. Most of our technologies come with a FREE trial with certain limitations.
