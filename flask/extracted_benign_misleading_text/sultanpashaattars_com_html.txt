Welcome to Sultan Pasha Attars.
We focus on creating olfactive poetry made with the rarest and finest natural absolutes and essential oils, tempered with only the minimal but necessary amounts of synthetics. We aim to make our compositions smell great but also evoke and trigger an emotional response, just as any good poetry or art should be able to do. Creating compositions with the deepest emotions, passion and thought so that they are transferred to and experienced by the wearer.
