Spread the word about CableWholesale
CableWholesale is committed to developing, producing, and marketing products that exceed performance, quality, value and safety requirements of our customers. At CableWholesale our goal and objectives reflect this commitment, not only through ongoing refinement of our unique, web based customer interface but also by providing free technical assistance and a large local inventory. Over the past 16 years, CableWholesale has evolved from a local start-up to an International Supplier with East and West Coast Domestic and Shanghai shipping locations. Product Quality is not always the same from supplier to supplier so CableWholesale operates under ISO9001:2008 and RoHS compliance (triple check report), providing Secured Shopping, (Reseller Protection) and a Lifetime warranty on most products!
"Our aim is to deliver a superior experience to our customers, while providing brand name quality at wholesale
prices."
