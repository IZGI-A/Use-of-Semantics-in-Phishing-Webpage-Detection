We are tired of all the phony advertising, "proprietary formulas", and the shady practices found in the supplement industry. You’ve seen the reports in the news of companies stuffing supplements with cheap fillers or spiking supplements with illegal ingredients. It’s insane.
That's why we launched Natural Stacks, the world's first open-source supplement company. Open Source means Ingredient Traceability, Full Label Disclosure, and 3rd Party Lab Testing.
We have partnered with the Cure Alzheimer's Fund, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization where 100% of the funds raised go directly to research.
Since its founding over $50,000,000 has been donated to research initiatives resulting in key breakthroughs including accelerated drug testing and a potential treatment.
Every Natural Stacks product sold helps fund research with the highest probability of preventing, slowing or reversing Alzheimer's disease.
Natural Stacks is proud to partner with practitioners around the globe to provide natural Open Source solutions for mood, memory, and focus.
From functional medicine providers in California, to Anti-Aging leaders in Florida, and naturopaths in Spain, clinicians Worldwide trust Natural Stacks’s science-backed formulas to help them support the mental wellness of their clients.
