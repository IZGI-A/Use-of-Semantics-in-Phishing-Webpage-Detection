diaspora* is a decentralized social network, consisting of many individual servers, called "pods". joindiaspora.com is only one server out of many and neither affiliated with nor supported by the project team. Please check out
the official project website on diasporafoundation.org
for more information about the project itself, as well as a list of all public diaspora* pods and information on how you can contribute!
Own your own data
Many networks use your data to make money by analysing your interactions and using this information to advertise things to you. diaspora* doesn’t use your data for any purpose other than allowing you to connect and share with others.
Choose your audience
diaspora*’s aspects allow you to share with just those people you want to. You can be as public or as private as you like. Share a funny photo with the whole world, or a deep secret just with your closest friends. You’re in control.
Be who you want to be
A lot of networks insist that you use your real identity. Not diaspora*. Here you can choose who you want to be, and share as much or as little about yourself as you want. It really is up to you how you want to interact with other people.
Decentralization
Diaspora* is completely decentralized, and any person from any pod can communicate with one
another! You can register at any of these
other pods
as well. You can also choose to
set up your own pod
if you'd like.
