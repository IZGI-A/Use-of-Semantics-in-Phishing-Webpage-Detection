Since 2001, Lauren's Hope has been your source for stylish, high quality medical alert jewelry. Originating with our Signature Style of fashionable, beaded, interchangeable medical ID bracelets, Lauren's Hope soon expanded to include medical alert bracelets and other medical identification jewelry (such as necklaces and dog tags) for adults and children in a variety of materials, styles, and colors. Medical ID jewelry was once unflattering and uncomfortable, but Lauren's Hope changed that, introducing medical ID fashions that hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are proud to wear.
It is our mission to design, craft, and sell great quality, fashionable medical alert bracelets and med ID accessories such as med alert keychains and medical jewelry charms so that you have options when it comes to protecting your wellness. Bracelets, necklaces, charms, and keyrings are all custom-engravable so that your most important information is always right at hand.
