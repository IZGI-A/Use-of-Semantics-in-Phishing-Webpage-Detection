Rollbar automates error monitoring and triaging, so developers can fix errors that matter within minutes, and build software quickly and painlessly.
Where is your software delivery process stuck?
If my Mean Time To Discovery is based on a customer support ticket, I’ve failed. Rollbar allows us to be ahead of our customers and fix issues before they know something is wrong.
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
gem 'rollbar'
# Then install
$ bundle install
# Or if you don't use bundler:
$ gem install rollbar
Configure and test
require 'rollbar'
Rollbar.configure do |config|
config.access_token = "ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
# Other Configuration Settings
end
Rollbar.debug("Hello World!")
It's that easy! Supports Rails, Sinatra, Rack, queues like Sidekiq, can inject JavaScript tracking, and more! Check out the docs for more info.
