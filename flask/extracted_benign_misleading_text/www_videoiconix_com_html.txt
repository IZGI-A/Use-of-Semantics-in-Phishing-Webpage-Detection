Thank you to viusalanimationstudios.com team for a wonderful experience building our first whiteboard video. The process was very smooth once we got the script written. The team was very responsive to all the changes we requested in a very timely manner, even over the holidays. We couldn't be more pleased with the final product.
We needed a video that would not just describe our business but would visually impact people and they would love to see or hear more. And this is exactly what we achieved from animationiconix.com Visuals look good; music sounds perfect; everything just assembles nicely. The video looks great, thank you!
Working with animationiconix.com was a Breeze! They handled our video with top notch professionalism from start to finish, catering to my expectations each step of the way. My team and I are all very pleased with the final outcome and would recommend them to anyone in respect to price/value, customer service and quality of what is created.
I came across animationiconix.com on the web and found their price to be reasonable. It took about a month to produce and the final product is awesome. My account manager was very good about making constant refinements to the video to satisfy my perfectionism. I am very proud of the final product and I think it shows of off unique Social Security Calculator very well!
