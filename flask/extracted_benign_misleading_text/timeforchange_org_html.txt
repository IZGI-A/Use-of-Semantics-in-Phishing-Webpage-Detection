- What drives us as human beings?
- Why do we exist?
- What is the purpose of life?
- What do we strive for?
«Time for change» is about your life, your objectives and your decisions. We are convinced that basic human needs are the same everywhere and finally we all strive for the same thing:
We want to be happy and satisfied and
we want to be able to live our lives
without worries and cares.
This search for harmony and inner peace, for self-fulfilment, self-realization, peace of mind, for calmness or however we may wish to describe this condition of our personality, is indisputably the top goal in the case of virtually all models of human needs.
- Have you already reached this goal of life? Or do you still have weaknesses which can disconcert you?
- Are you actively and consciously working towards happiness, joy and perpetual harmony?
- Have you clearly set out your objectives for living?
If not – this might just be the right time for change! This site offers thoughts and advice about personal growth, spiritual development and about the meaning of life. It’s also about ethically correct behaviour in the centre of daily life. «Time for change» is meant as a platform for sharing ideas and elucidations.
As a starting point, you might want to read some chapters of the book «ABC of awareness – personal development as the meaning of life» or download the pdf-file. We encourage you to generally to make your own critical thoughts about the information presented here.

What does personal growth have to do with the meaning of life? – An overview
With this website and with our range of lectures and consultation activities we would like to impart information about life’s most important interrelationship. In particular how we ourselves can set and achieve sensible objectives for our lives.
In addition we offer techniques and help with which personal growth towards harmony and inner peace can be consciously controlled and efficiently arranged. Our greatest interest is the integration and the concrete application of these thoughts to our everyday lives, both our working and our private lives.
There are more and more temptations for substitute dealings, which for a brief moment in time give us the illusion that we have reached the above mentioned objectives. Personality development and spiritual growth to reach a higher consciousness are however inevitable if inner peace and happiness are to become a lasting experience. We ourselves with the help of our subconscious are our best teachers and our environment both in private and business life are our best trainers.
One of the most important keys to personal growth is to realize that we can and must set the goals for our life ourselves instead of letting others (e.g. advertisement, family, media, „friends”) decide upon our goals (self-determination).
We are personally responsible for all our decisions, for whatever we do or do not do because from self-determination follows self-responsibility. Only through our deeds can we develop a higher consciousness over time and thus reach the above mentioned goals of perpetual harmony and inner peace.
In order to exercise responsibility, we also express our view on current issues of politics and society e.g. cause, effects and potential solutions for global warming, phase-out of nuclear power, the need to increase energy efficiency and more.
We ourselves together with the information presented here are independent of any religions, associations, sects, political and economic organizations or similar.
