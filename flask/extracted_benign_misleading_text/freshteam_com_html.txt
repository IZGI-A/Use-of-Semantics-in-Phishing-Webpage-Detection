Gather, save, access and flexibly update all employee information in Freshteam.
“Your recruiters won’t be switching between their email and ATS constantly, wasting time searching for information, running behind the hiring team or struggling with complex, clunky workflows (a feature of most enterprise products). With Freshteam, every stakeholder - recruiters, hiring team, employees - is onboard and happy.”
“Easy to use, great for small businesses - I had a professional looking career site in seconds. It’s very easy to use, I also like their Freshdesk platform and the pricing model that really lets you explore the software and get used to it before committing to pay.”
“Freshteam seemed to have everything we need to move candidates through the hiring process, and at a fair price. Competitors didn’t have everything we needed. The ones with more options had long integration processes and charged too much money; while still not checking all of our boxes.”
