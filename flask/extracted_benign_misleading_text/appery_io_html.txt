What our customers are saying
“We switched from Appcelerator to Appery.io to accelerate time to market and to develop apps more cost effectively. In our side by side comparison, an app that took us 1600 hours of senior developer time using Appcelerator took less than 500 hours to develop using Appery.io, and three quarters of that time was with a business analyst, not a developer.”
