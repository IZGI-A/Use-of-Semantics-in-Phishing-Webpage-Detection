Kingsborough Community College
Community college located in Brooklyn, New York
Kingsborough Community College (KBCC) needed ScholarChip’s Identity Management for their large student body, including a K-12 high school located on campus. KBCC uses turnstiles for Building Attendance and now students tap their ScholarChip One Card to pass through. If they are not enrolled, admittance is rejected. The One Card is our smart ID card and is also used for Campus Safety, enabling card holders to unlock secure doors, providing they have certain authorizations via the management website. Smart Forms are used throughout KBCC, students and staff can tap their card and all their contact information is submitted. It’s great for quick applications, signing up for an event, sports, etc.
Kingsborough has been named one of the leading community colleges in the country and serves a widely diverse population of approximately 14,000 students. KBBC is a major presence in the bustling borough of Brooklyn and has partnered with dozens of schools borough-wide to create a seamless transition to college. KBBC sponsors numerous activities year-round to meet the professional and cultural needs of the NYC community.
