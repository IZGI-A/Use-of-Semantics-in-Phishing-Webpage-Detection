Thank you very much for your wonderful lessons.I find them very helpful. I'm a teacher of English and it is very important for me to improve my English with the help of a native English speaker. In addition, your lessons are very useful for my classes. My students also like your lessons. You help us not only to learn English, but to know much more about the UK, Great job!
