Highly Recommended Equipment & Clothing
We developed the staff picks programme to help guide our customers to products that perform well in our tests, represent excellent value for money, are an out right bargain, or are simply awesome and feature some exciting technology that will help to push your skills to the next level.
Every staff member at Absolute-Snow is a passionate outdoor enthusiast who actively participates in the sports we represent. We care about products and want to make sure our customers are using the right equipment for them, so rest assured that all staff picks come personally recommended by people who are using the equipment every day, or understand that a product is excellent value for money.
All staff picks have the logo shown in the top right of their image, so keep an eye out when browsing the site. You can also toggle the staff picks button when browsing a list of products to just see all staff picks in that particular category. You will find this in the top left "experts" section of any listing page.
If you want personal advice, then don't hesitate to contact us for a recommendation by one of our staff members.
See you outside #ForTheExperience
