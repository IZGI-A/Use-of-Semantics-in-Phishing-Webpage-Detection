Why did we choose edrone? We needed a CRM system that would start collecting and analyzing customer data instantly without any hassle.

The first store that we integrated with edrone was Quiosque and the conversion rate quickly exceed our expectations. That is why all of our stores received the green light and top priority for for immediate edrone deployment. These include, among others, Bialcon, Ania Kruk
Duka.

Given the app’s simplicity, it allows the marketer to focus on increasing conversion by fine-tuning messaging and design, and leaving it to edrone to engage customers in the most effective way possible based on their preferences and behaviour.
