Pothi.com has played a very important role in my life as a writer. I have self-published a few books using this platform and have also listed my already printed books for sale here. I am very happy with their services.
I'm very thankful to Pothi.com - Jaya & Abhaya - for making my dream come true. I was writing since my childhood and they provided me the platform to reach an audience.
