TELUS EthicsLine
About the EthicsLine
At TELUS, and in partnership with EthicsPoint, our goal is to demonstrate the highest level of ethics and integrity in our business dealings with all stakeholders - customers, shareholders, suppliers, colleagues and community. All members of the TELUS team are expected to act honestly in all dealings, comply with all laws and regulations governing our business, and maintain an ethical work environment. It is the responsibility of TELUS employees to report, in good faith, any activity which may be a violation of any applicable law, regulation, or TELUS policy. Reports may be made anonymously.
The information you provide will be sent to us by EthicsPoint for action as outlined in our Code of Ethics & Conduct. Every effort will be made to maintain confidentiality, although disclosure may be necessary in some cases to effectively conduct an investigation or support legal proceedings. Retaliation against the person contacting EthicsLine or participating in an investigation of a complaint violates our ethical principles and will not be tolerated.
