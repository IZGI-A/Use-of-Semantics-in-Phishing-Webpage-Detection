I use Social Warfare because how things are shared when I'm not there to do it is important!

I’ve used every social sharing service you can name including hard coded buttons and none of them compare to Social Warfare. Social Warfare ROCKS!

We use Social Warfare on Social Media Examiner (we’re paying customers), and I like the way it aggregates all of the share counts.
Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner
It is very visually appealing, very fast so it doesn't slow down your site, and it gives you nice social sharing icons that you can put on your blog... and I get a lot of shares.
