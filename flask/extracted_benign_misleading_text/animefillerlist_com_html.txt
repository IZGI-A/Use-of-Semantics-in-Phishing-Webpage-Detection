Community created filler lists that help you get to the good stuff.
Anime is usually based on Manga, a type of Japanese comic popular with people of all ages.
"Filler" refers to story in an Anime that was not in the Manga. These are created because Anime production usually outpaces the Manga.
Fillers do not further the story and usually are of a lower quality both visually and narratively.
