What does Pixelfy do, and why is it important?
Pixelfy is more than a URL shortener. Our system not only takes a long URL and turns it into whatever you'd like; it also allows you to add a retargeting pixel to each link that you shorten.
The advantage of embeding a Pixel into your link is that, after a customer visits or takes action on your website; you can reach them again with targeted ads. Those Ads can be shown via Facebook, Twitter, Google and LinkedIn, and anywhere you want.Start Your 30-day Trial for $1 USD

What is retargeting?
It is a simple technique that helps your website visitors to remind the desire of engaging with your brand. You might identify it as remarketing too. Using a Pixel makes everything much simpler since it helps facilitate the personalization of ads shown to the customers. Those ads will have even more value and fit the needs of each user; which resulting in an easier monetization, and smoother transitions in the customer journey.
For example, imagine that you are running a Facebook campaign, with retargeting; you can now 'pixel' all the traffic you send to your listing or site, and then retarget it with another ad or another offer. Along with this, you will be able to collect the data behind the audience, e.g. demographics, locations, and operating systems, etc.Start Your 30-day Trial for $1 USD
What are mobile deep links?
Deep linking is when a link sends users directly into a specific point in the app experience, rather than an external website or app homepage. With pixelfy you can send users straight to the Amazon app vs traditional urls that open up a web browser where most people do not logged into their Amazon account. With mobile deep links some of our users have seen up to a 44% increase in their conversations.Start Your 30-day Trial for $1 USD
