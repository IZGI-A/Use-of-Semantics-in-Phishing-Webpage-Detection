I'm an AR/VR Developer and Digital Artist in Virtual Reality Development Company, who integrates well into teams and constantly studies and develops new skills and workflows and learns new tools and APIs.
I love reading your posts. We all have our moments. I have to say in private though, that is the silliest post I've ever read from you. It just won't happen. Where would they be relocated to where they can make a little money and survive?
