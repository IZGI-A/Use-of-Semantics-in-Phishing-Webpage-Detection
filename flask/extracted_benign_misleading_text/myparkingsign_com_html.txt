For over 100 years, generations of buyers specified and ordered our products. In fact, some of the very first parking signs in the US were made at our factory, and we’re still family owned and operated. Since then, we have grown to become the largest manufacturer and distributor of parking signs in the US.
While many others use lower cost materials and inks, we use the strict 3M Matched Component System as well as a clear 3M approved laminate. 3M Authorized means superior life – and signs that outlast graffiti and UV attack. Signs comply with the DOT MUTCD standards that now require reflectivity for parking signs in lots that are accessible to the public.
