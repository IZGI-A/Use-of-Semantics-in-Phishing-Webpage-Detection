Let's Build It Together
Your desk is where you work and create, so it's important that it's built to your specification. That's why we offer a wide range of useful accessories and desktop materials. Choose from 100 percent recycled wood desktops in our Eco line. Or, consider a GREENGUARD-certified laminate desktop, which provides excellent value while being indoor-air friendly and environmentally sound. Want an upgrade? Try our bamboo, reclaimed wood, custom handcrafted solid wood, or L-shaped desks. More of a do-it-yourselfer? Add your own desktop to our 2-leg, 3-leg, or 4-leg frames to create a custom stand up desk. And when off-the-shelf options aren't enough, we'll happily work with you to make the custom height adjustable desk you need.Shop Desks

DIY Standing Desks? A-OK

Our frames lift 355 pounds, and the telescoping crossbar accommodates desktops up to 90 inches wide and 30 inches deep. If you can build it, we can handle it.
With frames available in 2-leg, 3-leg, and 4-leg configurations, we work with almost any size and shape desktop. And if you don't see what you're looking for, just ask our experts, and we'll find a solution.Learn About Our Frames
The Key to a Height Adjustable Desk
Our advanced digital memory keypad stores up to four heights, allowing you to switch between sitting and standing with a quick touch of a button. Your exact desk height is shown on a display that automatically goes dark to reduce power draw while the desk is stationary. This advanced keypad is an upgrade to the standard two-button up/down keypad.Learn About Standing Desks
Take a Seat
Standing all day puts stress on your body just as sitting all day does. We recommend you start your day standing, sit when your feet get tired, and limit sitting to 30 minute sessions. Most studies are now recommending 2-4 hours of standing per 8 hour day. As a bonus, you burn about 50 extra calories per hour when you're standing versus sitting. We offer a full line of ergonomic chairs and stools to help you take a load off throughout the day. And remember, with height adjustability, you'll finally get to work at perfect sitting and standing heights without compromise.Shop Seating
Eco-Friendly Ergonomics
We responsibly source eco-friendly materials. We feature 100% recycled wood desktops, bamboo desktops, reclaimed wood desktops, and GREENGUARD-certified laminate desktops. Each one of our desktops is finished in either a GREENGUARD-certified technique or in another non-volatile, indoor air-safe method. Our monitor arm beams and desk frame feet are made of 100% aluminum for optimal stiffness and the ability to be recycled.Learn About Our Initiatives
