Make Money Taking Surveys
Incentives range in value from 100 to 5,000 Points per survey or research project, depending upon the time it takes. A Point equals a penny.
Your Voice Is Heard
Most members of American Consumer Opinion® enjoy having the opportunity to make their opinions count, to influence the future. It's similar to voting for elected officials—but here, you are voting on products and services you want in the future.
Evaluate New Products
You will have the opportunity to evaluate new products and new product ideas as well as optimize existing products and packaging designs.
Your participation will help companies determine which products are worthy of placement in the stores you shop in every day.
Test New Advertising
We do hundreds of surveys a year to help companies do a better job. Your opinions really do make a difference.
Your name and address will never be used for sales or advertising purposes, and your name will never be sold to anyone.
We Protect Your Privacy
Your opinions, information, and advice are confidential. Your answers are combined with other panel members' answers and reported as statistical summaries. Your individual answers will never be revealed to anyone without your explicit permission.
