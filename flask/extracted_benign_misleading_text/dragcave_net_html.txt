Welcome to Dragon Cave! Dragon Cave is an online adoptables game. Collect eggs, raise them to adulthood, and then breed them to create interesting lineages. New dragons are added regularly!
You enter the cave and see many large dragons scattered about, some with hatchlings, sleeping on piles of gold.
You also see a pile of scrolls on the ground. If you’d like, you can take one to record your travels on, or if you already have one, you can pick it up.
Near the entrance to the cave, there is a huge pile of abandoned eggs. If you don’t want the dragons inside to die, you can take one of those instead.
One of the scrolls in the pile contains a map charting dragon habitats across Galsreim and the surrounding area. Where would you like to travel?
