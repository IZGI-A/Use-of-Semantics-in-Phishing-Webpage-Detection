The fire district provides protection for the entire parish of Tensas, which includes 602 square miles of land, and an estimated population of 4,448 people in 2018.
The fire district is governed by the Fire District Board, which includes five representatives: one each from Newellton, St. Joseph, and Waterproof, and two appointed by the Police Jury.
All areas inside the limits of Tensas Parish have a fire rating of "7."
We are always looking to take on enthusiastic new volunteers.

Tensas Parish Fire District participates in the Louisiana State Fire Marshal's Operation Save-A-Life Program. Their goal is to greatly reduce fire related injuries and deaths across the state by providing smoke alarms to vulnerable citizens and at risk communities.
These smoke alarms must be installed by fire service personnel or representatives of the fire department.
The link below will take you to a form that can be submitted directly to Tensas Parish Fire District so that you can be contacted about the installation of a smoke alarm in your home.
