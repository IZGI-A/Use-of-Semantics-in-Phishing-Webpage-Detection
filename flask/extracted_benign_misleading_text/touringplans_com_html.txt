Disney World Crowd Calendar
Our Crowd Calendar shows how busy each Disney theme park every day of your trip, on a simple 1-to-10 scale. Using our crowd calendar, you'll be able to plan which park to visit each day to avoid crowds. You'll also see:
- Each park's opening and closing times
- The park's Extra Magic Hours schedule
- Any special events that might affect your visit
We're so confident in our crowd predictions that we show yesterday's results - our predictions and what actually happened - in the How We Did section of the page for everyone to see.
If you're trying to decide when to visit Walt Disney World, the crowd calendar will show you how busy Disney is across different weeks, months and seasons.

Know More at Walt Disney World Resort
Along with these trip planning tools, we've got hundreds of pages of travel advice including detailed ride reviews and on-board video, candid dining reviews from a professional chef, up-to-date, searchable menus and prices from every Disney restaurant, and Lines, our smartphone app rated #1 for Disney World in both iTunes and Google Play.
One of the first decisions you’ll have when booking a Disney World hotel room is which view to select. If you’re staying at the Yacht Club, for example, do any Garden View rooms have a view of the Stormalong Bay lazy river? If you’re on the monorail loop, does a Magic Kingdom View really improve your chances of seeing the Wishes fireworks? Is Savannah View at the Animal Kingdom Lodge worth the money?
To help you decide, we’ve spent the past year taking pictures of what you’ll see from the window of every Disney World hotel room – more than 30,000 individual photos. And they're all available here.
Why is choosing a room important? For one thing, you’re paying a premium to stay on-site. So consider these two photos, each of which is a room view you could get at random if you just let Disney make the decision for you. Don't leave your room view to chance. Find a great room and request it from Disney.
