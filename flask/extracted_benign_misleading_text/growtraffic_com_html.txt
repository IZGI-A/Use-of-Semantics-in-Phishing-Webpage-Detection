Step 1: Plan your campaign
As with all marketing campaigns, determining your traffic campaign takes a little planning. Plan on buying a large enough campaign to meet your goals; while most stat counters and traffic systems are very accurate, others don't count some views or visitors for no reason at all. For this reason, it's wise to overshoot your campaign a bit so that you have an ample amount of traffic going to your website if you're trying to meet a certain goal or if these stats are a high priority to you.
Step 2: Pick number of visitors and duration
Our campaign builder lets you choose how long you want your campaign to run, and approximately how many visitors total to send per day. This lets you build a campaign that is perfectly tailored to your needs.
Step 3: Pick a category and a location
Not only do we let you choose which country your visitors should come from, but we can also target to certain interests by showing your website only to a very select group of people. Most services charge extra for this service, but we include it in all of our campaigns.
Step 4: Place your order
We accept all major credit cards for our orders. Once you place your order, you'll receive a confirmation email from us, and we'll get your traffic campaign set up immediately.
Step 5: Sit back and enjoy
It can take up to 24 hours for us to configure and build your campaign, and several more hours for visitors to be redirected to your website. If after 48 hours you haven't seen any visitors, please email us, and we'll look into it immediately.
