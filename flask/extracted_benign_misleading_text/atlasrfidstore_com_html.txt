What is Radio Frequency Identification?
RFID is an acronym that stands for Radio Frequency Identification. RFID systems use tags and readers to keep track of various assets, inventory, or personnel. Tags are applied to products which can then be read with a standard device (i.e. reader) without having to be seen (this is one of several advantages of RFID over barcodes). The tags report back wirelessly and often without batteries. The power harnessed by the tag comes from electromagnetic waves generated by the RFID System.
RFID systems may be preferable to other methods (such as barcodes) because they allow for more efficiencies. With RFID you can read tags from yards away (or even farther) and you can creatively embed the tags so that they are not noticeable on the product.
From our headquarters in the Innovation Depot in Birmingham, Alabama, we have watched RFID change the way companies do business. We are excited to bring our customers the very best in RFID technology.
