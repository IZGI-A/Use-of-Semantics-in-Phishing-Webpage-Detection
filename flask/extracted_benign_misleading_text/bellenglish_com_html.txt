Learning brought to life
Since our first school opened in 1955, we've created success stories for students from all over the world, transforming the lives of over 1 million people. We teach students throughout their learning journey, from young learners to preparing for a degree at a top university.
We nurture and inspire young learners, aged 7-17, with courses to suit all interests and abilities. We advance students aged 16+ with English courses that can all be personalised to suit the ambitions of the student. We prepare students for independent life at university in the UK to achieve a top career.
Bell teaching experts also train teachers all over the world. Our teacher trainers include world-class names such as our Head of Teacher Development Silvana Richardson.
