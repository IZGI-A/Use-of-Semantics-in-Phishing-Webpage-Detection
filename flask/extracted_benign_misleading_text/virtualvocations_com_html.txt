I just wanted to let you know how comforting it is to know that there is a job site for freelancers like me that is actually legitimate. My main contracts are dwindling out and I have been using your site over the past year. I have gotten some job offers, and some of them have been almost perfectly matched to my skills. Thank you.

If not for your site, I don't know if I would have ever found this company.

Monday I began a new job I found on Virtual Vocations so I'm afraid I must now cancel my subscription. However, I am referring this site to many colleagues, as I feel this is by far one of the top sites for legitimate remote working opportunities. When the need arises I will definitely come back to you! Many thanks for providing this great service.

I just wanted to say "Thank You" for helping me find my dream job. I searched your website, became a member, and applied for a few positions. I received an offer from the first job I applied for and couldn't be happier about my future with my new employer and my new 100% telecommuting position. I will have more time at home with my family, fewer personal expenses, and a flexible schedule. Thank you again.
