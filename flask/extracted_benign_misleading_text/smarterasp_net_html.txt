At SmarterASP.NET, we specialize in Microsoft ASP.NET hosting. ASP.NET is a server-side Web application framework designed for Web development to produce dynamic Web pages. It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. Built around the Microsoft .NET Framework, ASP.NET provides the best possible environment to building and running dynamic applications. We support ASP.NET technologies such as ASP.NET MVC, Razor View Engine, Silverlight, ASP.NET AJAX, LINQ, WCF RIA Services, and Web Deploy.
