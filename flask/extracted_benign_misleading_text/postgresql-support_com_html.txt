* Do you know why the TTL (time to live) is so crucial for your DNS management?
Suggested article from our blog: TTL and how to check TTL
What is TTL:
TTL is a time limit that indicates the “freshness” of data. It shows how long data should be kept (current data). When it expires, the data is already old and needs to be deleted, and the device needs to be refreshed to get new, updated data.
When we are talking about DNS, it is the time, measured in seconds, that the DNS Recursive nameservers keep the DNS records. After this time, the servers need to refresh and get updated information from the primary nameserver.
You could experiment with the TTL value, depending on your needs and plan.
For CNAME record and TXT records, you can put 43200 (12 hours). We recommend a low value for MX record with dynamic IP.
In short, TTL shows the seconds, that the recursive DNS servers keep the information.* How to check the TTL?
