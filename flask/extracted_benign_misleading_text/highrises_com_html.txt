Why work with a Condo Expert?
If you're thinking about buying or selling a high-rise condo in your city then it's in your best interest to work with a local agent who specializes in the high-rise niche. First they can help you decide if living in a high-rise is the right choice for you. Then they can help you zero in on the buildings that best fit your needs. A high-rise expert will know what's happening in all the buildings regarding new construction nearby, possible litigation, HOA health and more. They may even know about condos that are available but aren't listed in the MLS yet. Once you've found the right condo, a condo expert can help you navigate the process which is a little different than buying a single family home. You'll need to review the condo resale certificate and CC&R's to make sure the HOA is in good condition and any possible assessments have been disclosed. Having a condo expert to guide you can help make the whole process a lot smoother and ensure a successful closing.
United States Ranked by Tallest Building in Each State
One of the most interesting things about skyscrapers and high-rises is their competitive aspects. The Empire State Building, The Burj Khalifa, and other tall buildings were built, in part, to say to the rest of the world: "Look what we can do!" There hasn't just been competition between countries, either - there has been some competition within the United States too! In this infographic, we take a look at the tallest buildings of each state. How tall would a state stand, based on its tallest building? Which states have the most high-rise buildings? What are most skyscrapers used for? We'll answer all these questions and more!
