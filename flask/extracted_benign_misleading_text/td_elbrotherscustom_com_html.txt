This is a basic course, generally used for relaying straightforward information that requires awareness and understanding, but does require practice or interaction. It includes simple, functional interactions in order to visually chunk information. A Level 1 course will look great and deliver the information, but doesn’t contain any upgraded interactions or media.
This course is the standard level of awesome for eLearning Brothers, and is the level preferred by many of our customers. Level 2 courses take the learner’s experience up a notch and include cognitive interactions allowing participants to apply information as well as experience a few special upgrades in just the right places.
In this enhanced course level, we use out-of-box ideas and experiences combined with innovation and media to make an impact on organizations. These courses focus on solving complex problems that require higher end competency and leave a lasting impression.
Learning games increase retention and encourage learners to engage in learning activities repeatedly and with excitement. Dashboards can drive competition as well which can be an effective motivator for development.
Mobile learning solutions are designed to function on tablets and mobile phones. Creative design ensures that activities will behave as expected on the go. Swiping, pinching, zooming, tapping, and scrolling are all taken into consideration before we move to development. These solutions are developed using rapid authoring tools with some web technology integrations.
