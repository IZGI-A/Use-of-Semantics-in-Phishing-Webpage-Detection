Join MNG Laboratories' Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Peter L. Nagy, and the Clinical Reporting Team as they present multiple case studies illustrating the value of using complementary testing and data analysis methods to increase the clinical sensitivity of MNGâ€™s genetic testing portfolio. The team will highlight cases solved through the application of high resolution CNV assessment, mitochondrial DNA analysis, transcriptome/RNA sequencing, and repeat expansion screening from genome sequencing datasets. After the presentation, there will be a 15 minute Q&A with our speakers.
Join us for a webinar presented by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Peter L. Nagy, to discuss the benefits of performing and analyzing genome and RNA sequencing together. The increased number of single nucleotide and copy number variants associated with genome sequencing are best interpreted with the help of joint parental testing and the assessment of the functional significance of intronic and regulatory changes with a functional test like the transcriptome.
