- General Admission Lottery
If you are not an author, workshop organizer, tutorial speaker or invited speaker, then you should join the registraiton lottery. You have until Sept 25th to join the lottery. Read about the lottery here. Information about applying for a visa is here. Check your lottery status here.
- Workshop Participants
If you have submitted a paper to a workshop, you should join the lottery by clicking the green registration above. All workshop presenters must register for the workshops to gain entrance into the convention center. Workshop organizers will have a limited number of reserve tickets to give to workshop presenters, and getting your ticket through the lottery would reduce the need for an organizer to consume their reserved tickets. Joining the lottery does not prevent a workshop organizer from giving you access to their pool of reserved tickets.

About NeurIPS
The purpose of the Neural Information Processing Systems annual meeting is to foster the exchange of research on neural information processing systems in their biological, technological, mathematical, and theoretical aspects. The core focus is peer-reviewed novel research which is presented and discussed in the general session, along with invited talks by leaders in their field. On Sunday is an Expo, where our top industry sponsors give talks, panels, demos, and workshops on topics that are of academic interest. On Monday are tutorials, which cover a broad background on current lines of inquiry, affinity group meetings, and the opening talk & reception. The general sessions are held Tuesday - Thursday, and include talks, posters, and demonstrations. Friday - Saturday are the workshops, which are smaller meetings focused on current topics, and provide an informal, cutting edge venue for discussion.
