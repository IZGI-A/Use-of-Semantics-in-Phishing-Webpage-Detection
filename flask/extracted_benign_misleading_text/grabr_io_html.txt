Why do I love travel? Well, it’s been a constant presence in my life for the last 15 years and it has opened so many doors for me. It’s turned me into a storyteller, opened my eyes to the beauty that exists in this world, and taught me about how other people live.Travel has compelled me to live fiercely and fearlessly, be open and inquisitive, and exercise more tolerance, empathy, and humanity. Because of travel, I now speak four languages, readily eat foods I can’t pronounce (nor identify by sight!) and navigate foreign cultures with ease. Travel has schooled me in ways the classroom never will, filled me with light and wonder, and shown me that magic exists on earth. So needless to say, it’s played a huge role in the person I am today-- its immensely positive impact is why I share my adventures with you all! I want travel to have the same impact on your lives!
