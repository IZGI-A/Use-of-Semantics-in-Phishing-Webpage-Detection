I read through The Epistle of Philemon, and contrast the slavery inherent within Islam to the freedom offered by Christ, liberator of the captives. I also try to explain the sheer incomprehensibility of much of the Koran as written.

ICE agents have used fake Facebook accounts to monitor suspected undocumented immigrants and lure them into raids in 2019, according to multiple reports. Most recently, a New York Times report detailed how ICE agents used Facebook and other social media to carry out a series of arrests in Oregon this summer. In one instance, according to the report, an undocumented woman named Gladys Díaz Tadeo made a Facebook post in a private buy/sell/trade group advertising a piñata that she had made with her three daughters. The next day, a Facebook account with a "Hispanic name" and a profile picture of...

South Lawn 11:53 A.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Hi, everybody. Hi. How are you? So, the stock market is doing very well. The economy is booming. We have a new record in sight. It could happen even today. But we have a new stock market record. I think it’ll be about 118 times that we’ve broken the record. Jobs look phenomenal. We’re doing very well in Syria, with Turkey and everybody else that we’re dealing with. We have secured the oil. We have a lot of oil. We’ve secured the oil. We have a couple of people that came knocking. We...

From Sandro Magister: Those images really break your heart Sandro Magister received the following letter which he published on his site on October 22, 2019. Dear Magister, The fascination of Amazonian rites (more or less) and statues representing pregnant women may be enchanting for the Synod Fathers and those around them, but they are creating trouble for Catholics in the Southern hemisphere of the world. Given that, even in the shanties of the global peripheries, people watch YOUTUBE and spend hours on FACEBOOK, those statues, take on a significance that is complicating the lives of [Catholic] catechists and missionaries, grappling...

The Trump administration has launched a pilot program that expedites the time it takes to process and deport asylum seekers at the U.S-Mexico border. Migrants arriving at the border in El Paso, Texas, can receive a decision regarding their asylum claims in 10 days or less, rather than undergo an asylum process that could take months or years, according to a report from the Washington Post. The new program, known as Prompt Asylum Claim Review, aims to deter illegal immigration and keep asylum seekers out of the U.S. The program just launched in October and is being conducted in the...

The idea of bringing the maligned Hummer brand back as a standalone electric-truck brand is likely to elicit quite the range of responses from longtime social- and eco-conscious car shoppers. General Motors is seriously considering that, as part of a full-size electric-truck push that will reach its full vigor in 2024 and may bring some new life to the plant that made the Chevy Volt. The potential product plans were reported Friday by Reuters, based on information from the UAW and multiple sources. GM originally gave its first hint that it was considering reviving Hummer back this past June. “I...

The Idols in the Tiber, Following Vatican’s Neo-Pagan Amazon Synod The Vatican's neo-pagan Amazon synod loses some wooden fetishes to angry Catholic laymen. St. Boniface, apostle to the Germans, cuts down the pagans' "sacred oak." Events around the world in recent years have followed a pattern. They seem like the plot of multiple bad end times sci-fi stories, all mashed together in one horrific, implausible mess. I’ve called this principle the Gunshow Apocalyptic Novel Insanity co-efficient.But when we look at the Catholic Church, this above isn’t quite accurate. In fact, events in my church echo quite a good apocalyptic novel....

Ever since the dawn of the age of unions, it has been a given that, even if society allows the concept of strikes against private business, it is illogical to allow striking against the government. Government employers are special cases, with monopoly status, providing necessary services (at least in theory). Everyone knows you cannot allow employees of the military, the police, the fire stations, the schools, the gas and electric utilities, etc. to strike. Society simply is no longer civilized, after awhile without these building blocks of a safe and civil society. And even so, some states do foolishly, self-destructively,...

… [A] simple, inexpensive, portable device that could produce hydrogen peroxide continuously from just air, water, and electricity, providing a way to sterilize wounds, food-preparation surfaces, and even water supplies. Even at low concentrations, hydrogen peroxide is an effective antibacterial agent, and after carrying out its sterilizing function it breaks down into plain water, in contrast to other agents such as chlorine that can leave unwanted byproducts from its production and use. Hydrogen peroxide is just water with an extra oxygen atom tacked on—it's H2O2, instead of H2O. That extra oxygen is relatively loosely bound, making it a highly reactive...

Ninotchka is a 1939 American comedy film made for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by producer and director Ernst Lubitsch and starring Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas. It was written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and Walter Reisch. Ninotchka is Greta Garbo's first full comedy, and her penultimate film. It is one of the first American movies which, under the cover of a satirical, light romance, depicted the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin as being rigid and gray, in this instance comparing it with the free and sunny Parisian society of pre-war years.

Gorny, 93 miles north of the border with Mongolia. Two of those killed were officers and the others were enlisted men. The two wounded soldiers reportedly were in serious condition. Russia’s Investigative Committee said it had opened a murder case against the suspect, whom it identified as 20-year-old Ramil Shamsutdinov. The Defense Ministry said the soldier apparently opened fire in a “nervous breakdown over personal problems unrelated to his military duties.”

RUSH: What do you mean, they’ve lost the monopoly of the news cycle? Folks, it’s all over the news that there is now a criminal investigation of the investigation into Trump! That’s all over the news cycle now. It’s everywhere. The New York Times, the Washington Post. And they’re doing CYA stuff on it. What’s the first thing CNN did? They went and got one of the conspirators, they went and got Andy McCabe to come out, and Andy McCabe told the Papadopoulos lie. I’m telling you, this is gonna be warp speed now because they think they have lost...

Embattled Congresswoman Katie Hill wanted her husband — with whom she reportedly had a “throuple” relationship that included a young staffer — to stay home and do all the housework because she hated chores, a new report claims. The sex-scandal-scarred California rep demanded that spouse Kenny Heslep live life as a “house husband” and left him to become entirely financially dependent on her, according to a CNBC report published Friday. “[Hill] told me that she did not like to do household chores and duties and wanted me to stay at home and do those things while she worked,” Heslep wrote...

An original Count Vlad pop rock song. I was told the song is a mystery in the sense of who it's about. Is it about the Count or his ex lover? In some songs the subject is unknown and the identity blends -- one is left guessing. If you like the music please subscribe.

RUSH: President Trump today met the press in his now famous, brilliant way. You know, the official White House press briefing is canceled. There aren’t any anymore. You know why? The president said, why should I allow these people a forum to make themselves famous at my expense? Nothing gets accomplished in these things anyway. It’s a tradition that doesn’t serve my purposes. It’s a waste of time. But rather than not talk to the press, he talks to the press more than ever. He’s talking to ’em, not the press secretary. He sees them as he leaves the White...

India: Muslims who killed Hindu leader say the murder was justified by Sharia OCT 25, 2019 3:00 PM BY ROBERT SPENCER We are constantly told in the West that Sharia is entirely benign, and that only racist, bigoted “Islamophobes” think otherwise. In reality, Islam mandates death for non-Muslim subjects of the Islamic state who mention “something impermissible about Allah, the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace), or Islam” (‘Umdat al-Salik, o11.10), and such laws are based upon passages in the Hadith and Sira in which Muhammad orders the murders of people who have insulted him. These include Abu...

9/11-style Plot Foiled, but France Perhaps 5 Years Away From “Irreversible” Immigration-caused Anarchy With France dodging another bullet and intelligence agencies foiling a 9/11-style plot, the nation’s interior minister admits that “60 attacks have been foiled since 2013 and every week people are arrested.” It’s yet another reminder why his predecessor warned that within five years France could face an “irreversible” situation that leads to the country’s break-up. As the Independent reports on the latest plot, “According to French paper Le Parisien, the suspect was looking for a weapon to hijack a plane.” “Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on France-2...
