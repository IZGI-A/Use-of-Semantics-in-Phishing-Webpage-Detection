Finally. Get those repetitive tasks out of your head and documented, so you’re not stuck doing everything yourself, forever.
Whether you manage a team or you’re hiring your first employee, SweetProcess gives you the systemization you need to scale and grow your business.
The procedures you create are more than just documents. They’re a living, breathing, operating manual designed to increase the productivity of your team.
Easy to read, highly visual, with interactive features like checkboxes and comments, all lead to a job well-done.
Attach screenshot images or embed videos to give extra clarity to any step in your procedures.
Just drag and drop or copy and paste. Who said documenting your processes has to be a pain?
Share procedures securely with teammates then monitor their progress as they complete each step.
Or, make your procedure public and share it with the world!
Did John finish the weekly email campaign this week? Which step is Jane up to in the client discovery process?
Know the answers to these questions and more. Track latest activity or look back in the history of any procedure.
Whether you’re working out in the field, in the warehouse, or at your desk, view your procedures using any computer, smartphone, or tablet.
SweetProcess is 100% mobile-optimized, so your procedures look just as good from your desktop as they do in the palm of your hand.
"Apple is a very disciplined company, and we have great processes... Process makes you more efficient."
"Using people to leverage a refined process multiplies production; But a poor process multiplies problems."
Stop spending time on repetitive tasks. Get them documented and out of your head, so someone else can do them. Now you’re free to focus on growing your business.
When an employee leaves, training their replacement is a breeze since all of their tasks have been documented and refined over time.
Procedures are easy to follow, illustrated with screenshots, videos and checkboxes to ensure no steps are missed.
A business built on a foundation of well-documented Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) has a higher value, which grows over time.

An active member is a person who has used SweetProcess in the last 14 days.
We truly feel it is unfair to charge you for a person who is not actively using SweetProcess... we are not that type of software company. You can add as many people as you want into SweetProcess and have the peace of mind knowing that you will only be billed for people who actively use it. Also if a person who was actively using SweetProcess becomes inactive you will receive a prorated credit to your account... It is a SweetDeal!
We’re here to help! Email us anytime at support@sweetprocess.com or call our phone number +1 (800) 476-0732 to talk to us.
Not seeing a measurable improvement to your business? We’ll refund your money, no-questions asked, and offer you a free 1-hour phone consultation to brainstorm strategies to grow your business.
