We're building on our competitively priced, 'no frills' ethos with a new range of key products at down to earth prices! You'll find them throughout the catalogue, including in our 'Gardening Essentials' - those items of equipment that no gardener should be without!
Dobies have been supplying flower and vegetable seeds direct to gardeners since 1880, starting in the Chester area, and for over fifty years now, to customers throughout the UK. An extensive range of products is featured in our main annual catalogue, which is sent free on request. In addition to seeds, we offer the largest range of young annual plants available by post, plus bulbs, fruit and garden equipment. Friends with, but not to be confused with Dobbies Garden Centre.
