Chris Davies MEP has been continuing the trend of his sweary ‘bollocks to Brexit’ Lib Dem MEP group, this time in an email in which he describes a group as “a bunch of lying duplicitous b*astards that spout greenwash”. To save the UK representative’s face, we’ve elected to keep schtum on who he was talking about…
The email was sent by the chair of the European Parliament’s Fisheries Committee yesterday, before attempting a Gmail recall four hours later. A Lib Dem press officer replied “How on earth did you get that… I don’t doubt for a second that this email is real” Unfortunately for Chris, not only had the email already been received and read – he’d actively put the quote in bold…
Labour MP Lord Stone has been suspended by the Labour Party following a report that details an astonishing period of behaviour from the former Marks & Spencer managing director. This isn’t any old scandal, it’s an Marks & Spencer scandal…
The 86-page report released by the Commissioner for Standards last night sets out in excruciating detail the exploits of his lordship, including several incidents of sexual language to female colleagues (including grabbing and undesired stroking); an occasion when Stone approached an anti-transphobia event stall and shouted that his guest “wanted the trans operation”; and claimed he wasn’t prejudiced with the extraordinary quote:
“I wouldn’t call somebody a ‘n****r’ in, like, in an aggressive way, but let us say I was at some meeting, which I often am, particularly in Israel with black people or whatever, I would say, ‘We are all n****rs, I am’ – what do you call it – ‘an honorary n****r’, yes, and they would say, ‘Yes, Andrew is just as n****r as we are'”
The commissioner recommended he goes on a training course…
Telly Guido tried to have a friendly chat with shouty Steve Bray, the ‘Stop Brexit’ man who interrupts every interview known to man. The story was going to be that the man is such an irritating staple outside Westminster he now has his own Uber pick up location. Then Steve started shouting. Guido decided that it was about time he got a taste of his own medicine…
Mel Stride – the former Treasury Minister – has been elected the new chair of the Treasury Select Committee, following Nicki Morgan’s appointment as DCMS Secretary. Now he gets to scrutinise the very policies he implemented in government…
It was thought that Cameron having to reduce the price of his book at Tory conference would be the low point of the former PM’s literary career. However, Guido now hears that the aversion to forking out for his book extends well beyond Tory Party members – to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson: his former PPS…
In a recent meeting with the PM, Cameron asked Williamson if he’d purchased his book, to which Gavin had to sheepishly admit he hadn’t yet (and as a Yorkshireman was holding out for a larger discount). Cameron promptly responded by throwing a copy of the book at him. Guido imagines Theresa will feel a twinge of jealousy over Cameron’s ability to lob something heavy at the former Defense secretary…
One of the Government’s digital ‘Get Ready for Brexit’ adverts has had an unfortunate digital error near City Hall in London. A pop-up reads that the program has “stopped working”. Perhaps this is why the Government want a technical extension…
The BBC have finally apologised to Priti Patel for falsely accusing her of laughing at warnings over a No Deal Brexit. In a statement responding to 222 written complaints, the corporation said that Marr “accepts this was in fact [Priti’s] natural expression”.
As any Londoner with a television knows, Sadiq Khan loves putting the environment at the forefront of his work in office and is today convening political and business leaders at the International Clean Air Summit to call for more powers to tackle air pollution. Perhaps he’d be better off organising a hot air summit…
As ever with Labour, the words fail to match the actions; as since taking charge of City Hall Sadiq has done surprisingly little to clean up the 1,034 vehicles in his GLA fleet – just7% of which are zero-emission. 93% of Sadiq’s fleet fails to meet the lofty standards he aims to force on Londoners…
This could have been expected, however, given the mayor is not on track to meet any of his lofty green promises. In 2016 he promised Londoners he would plant over two million trees during his first term in office. Based on current projections, the Mayor would need to plant over 200 trees an hour from now until election day to make good on his promise. Unluckily for Londoners’ lungs, Guido has more dirt on their mayor than their mayor has under his fingernails…
Now Guido can reveal that Yaqoob has also egged on the Rothschild conspiracy theory – a trope that even Momentum admit is anti-semitic.
In 2013 the wannabe candidate linked on Twitter to conspiratorial website about “Rothschild bankers” in Iceland and London, which itself pointed readers to a longer article hitting out at Rothschild “banking puppets”, asks readers to “End [the] New World Order”, and praises Viktor Orban’s Hungarian Government for “Kill[ing] The Rothschild Banks”. She is favourite to win the selection…

Journalist Flora Gill probably wasn’t expecting a reply from her mother, Amber Rudd, when she tweeted about responding to a direct message from the American man who took her virginity ten years ago on her Gap Year. Offering a helpful suggestion for her daughter’s “perfect response”the former Home Secretary suggested she like to speak to him…
Could it be that the former Home Secretary wants to put the cad in a hostile environment?
Well Amber, it’s your lucky day. Guido can reveal the man is Jamison Newall – we have his number if you want it….
In news that would attract more attention if not for Brexit, the government is briefing that there will be no the major tax cuts despite the promises Boris made during his leadership campaign, such as raising the income threshold for lower earners and increasing the 40% tax rate threshold from £50,000. Going into an election without having delivered Brexit or tax cuts means Boris definitely won’t be running on his record as PM.
Guido has been told in explicit terms “the cuts ain’t happening“, with the Treasury instead prioritising spending on infrastructure, such as roads and hospitals. The Treasury is already weary of Boris’s spend-happy approach to government, with the policies announced at Tory conference alone totaling almost £60 billion. Government borrowing was £9.4 billion in September according to data released yesterday. The first time in 5 years that the level of borrowing has increased year-on-year in September. Total borrowing for the financial year to date stands at £40.3 billion, £7.2 billion more than in the same period last year. In comparison the revenue lost to HMRC keeping the promise Boris made to raise the higher tax threshold for the middle classes looks like mere pocket change.
After last night’s shenanigans, and based on what Boris said to the Commons, once again Britain is cautiously returning to an election footing. It’s all in the hands of the EU for now…
Labour’s previously stated position is that they’re positively ecstatic about the thought of an election, provided Article 50 is extended to January next year. In a move as unsurprising as the sun rising in the morning, however, some Labour figures are showing signs of cold feet. Any wonder given Boris’s 15 point lead in the polls?…
Most obviously giving the game away is Lord Wood, who tweeted he wouldn’t actually back an election until around 2020…
An excuse that’s no doubt going to be parroted by Labour MPs keen on a second referendum…
Ken Clarke has also taken to the airwaves this morning, warning if Boris tries passing a bill to allow an election with just 50% support of MPs (rather than the two-thirds needed under the Fixed Terms Parliament Act), many Labour MPs will try amending it to allow votes at 16. Then Guido received an email from Momentum, crying out that Boris’s election call is, in fact, a ‘threat’.
The Tories can find some relief from Richard Burgon of all people, who said this morning that Labour will back an election “as soon as the EU agrees that extension.” Unfortunately in the same breath, he also gave pause for thought:
The Conservative Party’s greatest asset there…
UPDATE:The first Labour MP to openly say he’ll refuse an election even if the EU guarantee an extension to the end of January…
Yesterday, Peter Oborne published a characteristic scream of pain at the over-use of “Downing Street sources” by Lobby hacks. Oborne argued that the quoting of unnamed sources facilitates lying and makes hacks the hands free delivery mechanism for fake news. It is noticeable that, of late, tweeting Lobby hacks repeat anonymous threats from Downing Street sources which habitually do not eventually materialise. He pointed the finger at almost everyone from Laura Kuenssberg to Robert Peston. For hours after his piece was published, the customary tweeted insider nuggets of information were no longer dipped in the Downing Street source…
Nobody seemingly dared report anything “according to a Downing Street source”. ITV’s Paul Brand was the first to break the self-imposed embargo at teatime. His attribution was greeted by a barrage of abuse on Twitter. Twittering Lobby hacks went silent again on what Downing Street was saying…
“So here is No.10 confirming that if EU gives the requested three-month Brexit delay, Boris Johnson will ask for an immediate general election. Loads of you have poured buckets of manure on me for telling you what Downing St is thinking and saying. So you are totally at liberty to ignore this statement or disbelieve it. But it would be wholly wrong of me to withhold this from you, on the patronising assumption you cannot analyse and contextualise it.”
His tweet thread included a Whatsapp text from his undisclosed Downing Street source. He was combative (given he has made his career from repeating things he has been told by sources that is hardly surprising).
Perhaps emboldened by Pesto, at 10:05 pm Laura Kuenssberg risked tweeting “No 10 confirms tonight after the vote they’ll try to push for election if EU offers delay.*”She was greeted with tweets saying she was a Downing Street mouthpiece…
Oborne is right to say that hacks whose main journalistic asset appears to be phone numbers for spokesman really need to be less reliant on, and more careful about, re-broadcasting a line that the source would be too embarrassed to say in public. The reality is that it isn’t in the interests of hacks to open up the Lobby system or insist more often that quotes are on the record. Transparency will devalue their role because information scarcity makes their possession of a spokesman’s phone number more valuable. A start to improving and opening up the system would be to put Lobby briefings in the open and televised…
*Boris had in any case already said this publicly earlier in the day in the Commons.
As was announced by Parliamentary Authorities last week, Elizabeth Tower has begun the prolonged process of shedding some of its cladding.To the palpable relief of tourists who have experienced years of photographic disappointment…
This week, parliamentarians arrived in Westminster to see the tower’s spire had been uncladded, with more of the rooftop to be revealed over the next five weeks. Those opposed to Big Ben’s new rustic, utilitarian vibe, however, will be pleased to learn the scaffolding is still a long way from coming off entirely in 2021. Guido’s sure Extinction Rebellion will mourn the loss…
Selection for the safe seat of Ealing North is turning into a big mess for the Labour Party. Competing to win the seat and its 20,000 majority are some quite controversial characters. Local councillor Sitarah Anjum has already been removed from the shortlist of four after posting anti-gay marriage, pro-forced marriage, and ‘Israel is a war criminal’ tweets.[…] Read the rest
