By
selecting ’Continue’ and using Live Share, you are authorizing us to
view your HSBC Online Banking webpages. In doing this, we will use
software and services supplied by third parties providing support to us
in offering this service.
We can only view the
HSBC Online Banking webpages that you navigate to during a Live Share
session. We cannot view non-HSBC webpages and other applications.
Information
on HSBC Online Banking webpages, including any international accounts
added to Global View, will be visible to us during the session.
Exceptions to this are passwords and answers to security questions,
which will be masked. Any information that may be disclosed to us during
the session will be used to help answer your questions and assist you
with your online banking.
You will be in
control of your screen throughout the session. During a Live Share
session, we cannot: (1) take control of your HSBC Online Banking
webpages; (2) make any changes to your HSBC Online Banking webpages; or
(3) initiate any transactions through your HSBC Online Banking profile.
Your
Live Share session may be recorded for quality monitoring and training
purposes, and as a record of information exchanged, pursuant to HSBC’s Privacy Code.
You
can terminate the Live Share session at any time by selecting ’End
session’, selecting the ’X’ icon on your Live Share frame, or closing
the browser.
