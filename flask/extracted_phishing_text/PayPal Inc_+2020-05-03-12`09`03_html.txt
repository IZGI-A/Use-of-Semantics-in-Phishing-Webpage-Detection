Every transaction is monitored in real time and accounts are analysed to help prevent fraudulent activity and payments.
We monitor transactions 24/7 so, if we notice something out of the ordinary, we’ll ask you to confirm it’s you logging in or making the purchase. We also follow up every purchase and sale with an email.
Download the PayPal app to receive push notifications to your smartphone in real time when you make a purchase or get paid.
If you see a transaction you didn’t authorise, open the details and click Report a problem > I need to report unauthorised activity, or call us immediately.
Review your recent transaction activity and account settings to see if any further charges or changes were made, and report those too.
You can do this in your account settings under Security. Or, if you can’t log in to your account, click Log In > Having trouble logging in? to reset it.
If we suspect a problem with a sale you’ve made, we’ll let you know right away and ask you to delay shipping. This gives us time to investigate and ensure your business avoids unnecessary losses.
