There is a famous African proverb: if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.
Trianumâ€™s ethos of team work is a true testament to this proverb. Over the eight years of operation, Trianum has evolved from a company founded by 3 entrepreneurs to a company that has over 90 staff members with distinct roles across the portfolio.
