When you choose Remember Me on sign in, we will remember
who you are and keep you signed in for up to 30 days
unless you sign out. This is great if you sign in all the
time to check your email or watch TV shows online.
But be careful: If you share your personal computer with
others, they could access and make some changes to your
account. You should definitely not use Remember Me in
public computers!
Facebook Connect is available for signing in to all of
your XFINITY services except XFINITY Connect, XFINITY
Home, and your account section within MyAccount.
