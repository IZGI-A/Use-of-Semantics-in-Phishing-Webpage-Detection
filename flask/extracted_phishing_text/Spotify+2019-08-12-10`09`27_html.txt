Spotify will make a temporary authorization on your card to verify it. This is an authorization only and NOT a charge. Your bank may inform you of the authorization.
You hereby authorise Spotify to charge you automatically every month until you cancel your subscription. If you don't cancel your subscription before the offer ends (check your account page for details), you will automatically be charged the standard price every month until you cancel.
