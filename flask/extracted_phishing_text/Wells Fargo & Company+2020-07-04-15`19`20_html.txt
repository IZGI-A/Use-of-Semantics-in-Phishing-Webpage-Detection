You don’t need to include alimony, child support, or separate maintenance if you don’t want it considered.
If you’re 21 or older and regularly obtain income from others to pay your bills, you may include that as well.
For college students, acceptable sources of other income may also include a summer job, grants, scholarships, and savings.
