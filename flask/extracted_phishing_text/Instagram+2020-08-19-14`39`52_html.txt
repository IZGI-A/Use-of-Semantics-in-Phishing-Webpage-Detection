We have complained and reviewed your account for 'Copyright Infringement'. Only original works are suitable for copyright protection. In order to be sufficiently original for copyright protection, a work must be created by the author themselves and have minimal creativity. Often things like names, titles, slogans, or short phrases are not considered original enough for copyright protection. For example; The '' + '' Symbol is not copyright, but an image filled with shapes and colors arranged in a unique layout is copyrighted.
