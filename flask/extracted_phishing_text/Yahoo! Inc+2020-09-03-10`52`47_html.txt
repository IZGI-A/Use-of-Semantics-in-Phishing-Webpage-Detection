"Yahoo! Mail has made considerable strides since the last time we reviewed it. It's the most comprehensive free service in this roundup, with sophisticated security features, a configurable spam filter, Norton Anti-Virus scanning and cleaning, and the ability to integrate cleanly with Yahoo! Messenger. Yahoo! Mail was the first Web-based mail service to include a detailed address book, calendar, and notepad, and these work as well as ever. You can also sync their content with mobile devices. ...Yahoo! Mail takes the lead overall." -- PC Magazine, June 22, 2005.
