No Advice or Recommendations
- The information provided herein is not directed at any investor or category of investors and is provided solely as general information and to otherwise provide general investment education. No information contained herein should be regarded as a suggestion to engage in or refrain from any investment-related course of action as Deutsche Bank AG, its branches and all affiliated companies (“Deutsche Bank”) is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, act as an impartial adviser, or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the materials presented herein. If you are an individual retirement investor, contact your financial advisor or other non- Deutsche Bank fiduciary about whether any given investment idea, strategy, product or service described herein may be appropriate for your circumstances.
- Except as otherwise specifically agreed in writing or as provided in any other terms and conditions applicable to transactions conducted between Client and Deutsche Bank through the Website nothing on this Website is an offer which can be accepted by Client so as to create contractual obligations without further action by Deutsche Bank;
- Opinions, estimates and projections in any research report accessed via the Website constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of the report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice.
- Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend reports accessed via the Website or to otherwise notify Client thereof in the event that any matter stated in such reports, or any opinion, projection, forecast or estimate set forth in such reports, change or subsequently becomes inaccurate, or if research on the subject company is withdrawn.
- Prices and availability of financial instruments also are subject to change without notice. The Website (including all research reports accessed via it) is provided for informational purposes only. It is not to be construed as an offer to buy or sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy in any jurisdiction. Any financial instruments discussed may not be suitable for all investors and Client must make their own investment decisions using their own independent advisors as they believe necessary and based upon their specific financial situations and investment objectives.
- If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than a Client’s currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the price or value of, or the income derived from, the financial instrument, and Client effectively assumes currency risk.
- Income from an investment may fluctuate and the price or value of financial instruments described in this report, either directly or indirectly, may rise or fall. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

Hypothetical Forecasts
Some of the materials presented in the Website may allow Clients to perform calculations and carry out analysis on the basis of hypothetical results, figures and indices. Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations. There are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. Client should recognise that hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account of the impact of financial risk in actual trading, for example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of losses are material points which also can adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.
