Is saving my details safe?
If you tick the 'remember me' box, your details will only be retained on the device you're using at the time. That's why we don't recommend you do so on any public or shared devices. This means you don't need to worry about anyone else seeing the details. Even if they do, there isn't enough information there for anyone to access your accounts in Online Banking or any other way.
If you want to save your details, you need to make sure you've switched cookies on for your browser – that's how the information is stored.
