*The disclosed Dividend Rate and Annual Percentage Yield (APY) are the prospective rates and yields that Alaska USA anticipates paying for the applicable dividend period. The dividend method you select may affect certificate earnings. There is a penalty for early withdrawal from a certificate or IRA certificate. In the event an early withdrawal lowers the certificate balance below the required minimum, the certificate must be cancelled or closed, and the forfeiture amount will be calculated using the full balance of the certificate.
