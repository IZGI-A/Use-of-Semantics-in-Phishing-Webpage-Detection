Good value
Long battery life
Small form factor
Good product, value is almost there
I bought this device to replace my fiances and my broken phones. One of each available color-way. Both are beautiful, premium feeling phones with great battery life - the wireless charging a true feature I didn't realize I was missing. The form factor of the device is pretty decent.. a middle ground between the non-plus iPhones from years past and the phablets Apple will soon be making even larger... something I may need to explore when it touches down. Coming from a (beloved) 6s plus, I do miss the hand feel and typing experience familiar with my old phone.Read full review…
