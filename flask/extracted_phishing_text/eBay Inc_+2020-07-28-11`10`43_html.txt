Pair of 2008 Yamaha Fx, there are in great condition, they have 57 & 59 hours and run great. They comes with 4 stroke, which is very reliable and lots of power. These jetski have variable trim, tilt steering, a large storageÂ compartment in the front, another under the rear seat and also have step ladder which make getting on the ski a breeze when in the water. I am including the two flush kits, ropes for when dropping the skis in the water, two lanyards and anchor.Â It has minimum scratches from normal use and a small tear. Skis come with Continental double trailer.
